"Abe1981","Sampling strategy","In August 1979, 17 sample trees in a quadrate (15 m times 10 m) of a 53 year-old plantation were cut down (Abe 1980). The stand was facing the north-east with slope of 13 to 20 degree. Five trees were selected to represent each diameter class. These five trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, and at intervals of 1 m upward to the crown base and in horizontal strata defined by whorl brahces from crown base to the stem apex. For the remaining 12 tress, stems were cut into parts contained in horizontal layer or 0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, and at intervals of 3.65 m upward to the crown base, and in horizontal strata defined by whorl brahces from crown base to the stem apex."

"Abe1981","Height","Metadata not available."
"Abe1981","Biomass","For stem biomass, fresh mass was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass. The ratio was estimated from subsamples taken from each tree at each layer. For branch and leaf biomass, total fresh mass of branches and leaves were converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass. Then, dry mass of branches and leaves were converted to branch dry mass and leaf dry mass by the ratio of leaf to branch dry mass. Both ratios were estimated from subsamples taken from each tree at each whorl stratum. All samples were oven-dried at 90 degrees C for 96 hours."

"Ando1962","Sampling strategy","Study was conducted in a naturally regenerated secondary Pine forest (Block I in the Takadateyama National Forest, compartment 91-Ne, Na, and Tsu, 200 m a.s.l.). For Block III see Tadaki 1979. Three plots with size of 0.01 ha (10 m times 10 m) were set in the stand in 1951 (Ando et al. 1962). These plots were facing the south. The stand was treated to regenerate naturally during 1942 to 1947 and was estimated to be 8 years old in 1951. Plots were treated with different treatments in 1951-1952. Plot A  (sparse) was thinned to avoid strong competition. Plot B  (1000 trees/ha) was thinned to a density of 10,000 trees/ha in 1952. Plot C (control) was untreated. A total of 70 trees were cut down (20 from plot A, 20 from plot B, and 30 from plot C). Trees were selected randomly. Stems of sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0.0-0.2 m, 0.2-0.7m, and at interval of 0.5 m upward. Leaves and branches were separated."

"Ando1973","Sampling strategy","Plots 1-A and 1-B in Maruyama experimental stand were facing the south-east at 180 a.s.l. and planted with Acacia mollissima in 1963 at the density of 2000 trees / ha and 4000 trees / ha, respectively (Ando and Takeuchi 1973).  Plots 1-A and 1-B in Haseyama experimental stand were facing the north at 200 a.s.l. and planted with Acacia dealbata in 1963 at the density of 2000 trees/ha and 4000 trees/ha, respectively. Details of the plots are listed in Table 1 of Ando and Takeuchi (1973). Eight sample trees covering whole range of diameter distribution were harvested from each plot in late November to early December 1967. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 1 m thickness. Fresh weight of stem, branches, leaves, and flowering buds were measured in the field. For three sample trees (large-, middle, small-sized trees) per plot, roots were excavated  in quadrate plots centred on the stump of sampled tress. The area of quadrate plot was 5 square meters for a tree in density of 2000 trees/ha (plots 1-A) and 2.5 square meters for a tree in density of 4000 trees/ha (plots 1-B). All roots within this quadrate plot was assumed to be of the sample tree."

In Cryptomeria japonica, leaves and green braches were difficult to seperate. Green parts of the main axis of the stem or large branches were treated as branch and those of lateral axes as leaves. Subsamples of each organ from each layer and each tree were taken and oven-dried at 80 degrees C for 48 hours or more. The dry-to-fresh weight ratios of these subsamples were used to calculate total dry weight of each tree component."

"Aspinwall2013","Sampling strategy","Completed above and belowround harvests were conducted during the winter of 2008 and the winter of 2009.  We harvested 9 Pinus taeda genotypes in total; 3 clones, 3 full-sib families, and 3 half-sib families. 2 clones were planted as containerized and bare-root seedlings, such that there were actually 11 'individuals'.  In winter 2008 (age 2), we harvested four trees of each genotype and the study location (Onslow County, NC, USA, managed pine plantation).  We conducted the same harvesting protocol on 2 trees per genotype in winter 2009 (age 3).  With one missing tree, we have data on 65 trees.  "
"Aspinwall2013","Leaf area","For each tree, a randomly sampled subset of needles was collected from throught the canopy.  These needles were scanned (Epson scanner) and the images were analyzed using ImageJ software to estimate total fresh area of the subsample.  The needles were then oven dried (70 C), and one-side SLA (cm2 g-1) for each tree was determined.  This SLA values was then multiplied by total needle dry mass to estimate total canopy one-sided leaf area (m2)"

"Aspinwall2013","Crown area","Not measured."
"Aspinwall2013","Biomass","The general harvest protoco was as follows: Ground-line diameter and height were measured and each tree was felled onto a tarp. The aboveground portion was then separated into foliage, branches, and stem. Briefly, total fresh mass of each component was measured in the field and a subsample representing *25 % of the component fresh mass was weighed and dried to a constant mass at 70  C. Total dry mass (kg) of each component was calculated as the product of total fresh weight and subsample moisture content (%). Following the aboveground harvest, a 0.5 m3 volume of soil, centered on the cut stem, was carefully excavated so that taproot, coarse root, and fine root biomass could be estimated.  Samples were sieved, washed and dried at 70 C to estimate dry mass. "

"Baltzer2007","Sampling strategy","Seeds were of local provenance obtained from the National Tree Seed Centre (Canadian Forest Service Atlantic Forestry Centre, Fredericton, NB) and grown in glasshouse at the Faculty of Forestry, University of Toronto (CA), under high and low nutrient and light treatments. Individuals sampled from 1 to 5 months of age. Biomass harvests were conducted on 5-6 June, 21-23 July and 3-5 September 2003. Betula papyrifera and Populus grandidentata showed low germination rates and therefore seedlings were not available for the first harvest.

"BondLamberty2002","Sampling strategy","Aboveground biomass relations were based on 326 trees harvested during three field seasons, 1994, 1999, and 2000. Allometric coefficients for trees harvested in 1994 were previously published (Gower et al. 1997), although with different coefficients, as this study denominates tree mass in grams and not kilograms. In addition, Gower et al. (1997) did not measure D0 and only reported equations for mature trees based on DBH. Trees were destructively sampled between mid-July and early August in each year. Stems were cut at the soil surface."

The height range for each species in July 2001 was as follows: Luehea (0.56-4.42 m), Cordia (1.9-3.32 m), Sterculia (0.58-5.15 m), Antirrhoea (0.57-2.77 m), Enterolobium (1.66-2.48 m), Cedrela (0.56-3.57 m), Tabebuia (0.37-3.18 m) and Hura (0.76-4.85 m). Care was taken to sample a similar height range from all species. Differences in total height among individuals were caused by differences in growth caused by micro-scale variations in topography. All sampled individuals were healthy. Within each size category, one individual per species was randomly selected for allometric and biomass measurements. Sample size was thus five trees per species for a total of forty saplings. Each of the experimental saplings was harvested and the root system excavated and the following traits were measured: (1) diameter at 10 cm from the ground; (2) height; (3) number, length and biomass of branches;(4) trunk biomass and (5) root biomass. All leaves from the saplings were harvested and dried to provide total leaf biomass."
"Coll2008","Leaf area","Specific leaf area (SLA) calculated from another study (Delagrange et al. 2008) was used to scale up biomass of leaves to total leaf area per tree.

"Epron2011","Sampling strategy","Before each sampling campaign tree height and tree circumference were measured on three inner plots which contained 25 tree positions for each fertilization regime (excluding 2 buffer rows). Eight trees covering the range of basal area were destructively sampled at each age for each fertilization regime. The mass of each tree component was measured on-site and sub-samples were dried until constant weight at 65 C to estimate the dry mass of each tree component. Allometric relationships were then established and applied to stand inventory."
"Epron2011","Leaf area"," The green crown length of the sampled trees was divided into three equal-length sections (lower, middle and upper). All leaves of each section were removed and weighed. Thirty leaves were randomly selected in each section, and their fresh mass and area were immediately measured. These leaves were then dried at 65 C and the dry weight of each sub-sample was used in conjunction with its measured area to calculate the specific leaf area (SLA) for each crown section. The dry weight of leaves in each section was multiplied by the SLA value to estimate the leaf area in each tree section. Total tree leaf area was estimated summing the leaf area of the 3 sections."
"Epron2011","Stem cross sectional area","Stem circumference over bark was measured at breast height (1.30 m). After felling,  a disc of stem was cut at a height of 1.30 m and the bark was removed. The circumference under bark was measured on the disc and the stem cross sectional areas over bark and under bark were calculated from the measurements of stem circumference. Colored water was passed under pressure through a piece of trunk at 1.30 m above the ground to determine the sapwood area for a subsample of the trees to establish an allometric relationship that was applied to the other trees."

"Harada1972","Sampling strategy","Survey was conducted from 1963 to 1967 in 14 Cryptomeria stands (28-59 years) in 5 regions: Chichibu (Saitama Prefecture, Paleozoic soil), Keta (Shizuoka Prefecture, Mesozoic soil), Amagi (Shizuoka Prefecture, volcanic ash soil), Murakami (Niigata Prefecture, Tertiary soil), and Hakone (Shizuoka Prefecture, volcanic ash soil) (Harada et al. 1972). Diameter at breast height, tree height, and height of the lowest living branch were measured for all living trees in the stands. In each stand, 5-8 sample trees were selected to represent each diameter class. Sample trees were felled and separated into stem, branches, and greenish parts (leaves and green twigs). Branches and greenish parts were treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 2 m thickness. Fresh weights of branches and greenish parts in each layer were measured and subsamples were taken.  Subsamples of greenish parts (500-1000 g) were separated into leaves and greenish twigs. Because distinction of leaves from greenish twigs was difficult in Cryptomeria japonica, greenish parts from the tip to the secondary branching were treated as leaves and remaining greenish parts as greenish twigs. Leaves and greenish twigs were weighted to obtain the ratio of leaves or greenish twigs to greenish parts for each stand and each layer. Then, fresh weight of leaves or greenish twigs was estimated from this ratio and fresh weight of greenish parts. Fresh weight of stem was measured directly or estimated from volume and the ratio of fresh weight to volume of subsamples. Roots of two to three trees per stand were excavated from plots centered on the stump of sampled tress. Area of a plot was equivalent or half of the mean occupancy area of a tree. Roots were separated into layers and further into main, coarse (diameter >= 2 cm), medium (0.2-2 cm), fine (< 0.2 cm) roots and weighted."

For evergreen conifer species (Abies sachalinensis and Picea jezoensis), fresh mass of trunk, branches without leaves, branches with leaves, and roots was weighed. Measured fresh mass was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass.  The ratio was estimated from subsample taken from each tree and each organ. A disk of ca. 3 cm thick was taken from the base, middle, and near top heights of trunk for a sampled tree with the DBH > 0.1 m and the fresh mass was measured.

The stands regenerated from sprouts and seeds after clear cutting in 1940-1950s, located on the middle of the slope (ca. 80 m a.s.l.), and was pure stands of Castanopsis cuspidata with a few Quercus glauca. Sampling was conducted in four plots (plot 2, 4, 6, 8) in December 1967, and in adjacent stands in November 1961, December 1963, November 1965.  Trees in the plots were thinned in the spring of 1961 to the density of 4125 trees/ha for plot 2, 7500 for plot 4, 32100 for plot 6 and 18400 for plot 8. In four plots, trees were selected to cover size ranges. In adjacent stands, all trees within a defined area (5 or 15 square meter) and several large trees outside the area were cut down. After felling tree, tree height, height of the lowest living branch, and stem diameters at breast height were measured. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 1 m depth and separated into stem, branches, and leaves. Roots were excavated. We only included data of single-stem trees for this data paper."
"Tadaki1995","Leaf area","Total leaf area was estimated from fresh mass of leaves and leaf area/leaf mass ratios obtained from subsamples. For sampled trees from adjacent stands, average leaf area/leaf mass ratios was used for each sampling. For sampled trees from plots 2, 4, 6, and 8, leaf area/leaf mass ratios of each layer was used. Leaf area was measured by the dot-counting method proposed by Negishi et al. (1957, J. Jp. For. Soc. 39: 380-384) (Tadaki et al. 1962, J. Jp. For. Soc. 44: 350-359).

"Takagi2010","Sampling strategy","The study was conducted in natural forests at the Teshio Experimental Forest, Hokkaido University (Takagi et al. 2010). Seven or eight trees per species were selected to cover wide range of diameter at breast height (DBH) in late August of 2001 through 2007."

"Takagi2010","Crown area","The crown widths for the two directions (north to south, east to west) were measured before cutting each tree (Takagi et al. 2010)."
"Takagi2010","Biomass","The fresh mass of each organ (trunk, branches, and leaves) was weighed at 2-m height intervals along the trunk of each sampled tree (Takagi et al. 2010). The trunk was defined as the part that directly connects with roots and reaches the top of the tree, and the remaining woody aboveground parts were categorized as branches. The heights of branches and leaves were categorized based on the actual position in the stand, not by the height connecting with the trunk. Branches were divided into three categories based on diameter (<2 cm, 2-5 cm, and >5 cm), and the fresh mass was measured for each category at 2-m height intervals. For Betula and Quercus, all leaves were separated from the trunks and branches and the fresh mass was measured. For Abies, all leaves were separated from the trunk and branches when these woody parts were more than 2 cm in diameter. For those branches less than 2 cm in diameter, subsample of the branches with leaves (>1.5 kg fresh mass) was separated into leaves and branches at 2-m height intervals, and the leaf/branch dry mass ratio was applied to all the branches with leaves to estimate each leaf and branch dry mass for each height. For an Abies tree with a 50.16-cm DBH, the leaf/branch dry mass ratio ranged 0.430-0.468, and the average and standard deviation of the 10 height categories (21.35 m in the tree height) were 0.446 and 0.011, respectively. Even if we assume that the deviation in the ratio among the height categories was caused only by the sampling error, this leaf dry mass estimation procedure causes < +/- 2% error (or +/- 1.9 of 117 kg dry leaf mass) for this tree. Stumps with roots were pulled out using a backhoe, and the remaining roots were dug up manually using shovels. The soil on roots was completely washed away by spraying river water on site with a compressor and using brushes. Roots were split into four categories based on diameter (< 2 cm, 2-5 cm, 5-10 cm, and >10 cm), and the fresh mass was measured for each category. Fine roots (< ca.0.5 cm in diameter) were not collected. A disk of ca. 3 cm thick was taken from each 2-m interval of trunk of a sampled tree, and the fresh mass was measured. Each disk was oven-dried at 70-80˚C until there was no change in the mass (typically it took 1 month), and the dry mass was measured. The trunk dry mass was then estimated at each 2-m interval by multiplying its fresh mass by the dry/fresh mass ratio of the disk sample. For branches, coarse roots, and leaves, typically 1-3 kg of the fresh subsample was weighed for each 2-m height interval and each branch and coarse-root diameter class and oven-dried at 70-80˚C until there was no change in the mass. The dry mass was estimated by multiplying the fresh mass by the dry/fresh mass ratio of the sample for each diameter (branches and coarse roots) and height classes."

The tree was harvested using a chainsaw. The stumps were numbered with the corresponding tree number and the height of each stump was measured. Most of the trees were snigged to the logging dump by a skidder or excavator; large trees had their crown component cut in the forest and each component snigged to the logging dump separately. A visual assessment was made to estimate any losses (crown, branches and bark) that may have occurred due to transport of the trees from the forest to the logging dump and their handling. The length, and butt, top and centre diameters of each log were measured. Samples were cut from the log products, crown and bark for laboratory analysis (moisture content, density and sapwood content)."
"Ximenes2004","Biomass","Trees weighing less than five tonnes were weighed as a whole. Trees heavier than five tonnes required further cutting before their weight was determined. The commercial log(s) was debarked, graded and weighed. The biomass was weighed on weigh bars mounted on top of a trailer especially designed and built for the CRCGA research. An excavator was used to lift the biomass components onto the trailer. The trailer is equipped with a heavy upper frame and each corner is supported by a two-speed drop leg. The nominal dimensions of the trailer are: length load space: 2.5 m; length overall: 4.1m; width load space: 1.8 m; width overall: 1.8m. Both weigh bars are equipped with two load cells with a combined capacity of 5 tonnes. Weight increments of 0.2 kg are displayed on a digital display. The weight of stumps was determined by multiplying their volume by the green density of the 'butt' section of the respective tree. The volume of the stumps was determined assuming, for practical reasons, they approached the form of the cylinder (Husch et al 1972). The weight of trees that had a component of bark, crown or branches missing was adjusted based on a visual assessment of the loss."

"Yamaba2007","Sampling strategy","Quercus serrata were sampled in two Q. serrata dominated secondary natural forests in 2005: Miyoshi city-1 (215 m a.l.s; NE facing slope; slope = 13 degrees) and Shobara city-2 (580 m; NE; 28 degrees) (Yamaba 2007). Both sites used to be dominated by Pinus densiflora before many pine trees were killed by pine wilt disease. P. densiflora were sampled in P. densiflora dominated secondary natural forest at Higashihiroshima city-3 (415 m; SE; 5 degrees) in August 2006. Chamaecyparis obtusa was sampled in two plantations in 2004: Miyoshi city-Toukaichimachi (207m; E; 12 degrees) and Shobara city-Nigorikawachyo (484 m; SW; 33 degrees). Within each site, 20 times 20 m quadrate was created and stem diameter at breast height and tree height of all trees within the quadrate were measured. One dominant tree, two average-sized trees, and one suppressed tree were chosen from each quadrate and were cut down. Sample trees were treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0.2-1.2 m, and at intervals of 1 m upward for evergreen gymnosperm and in horizontal layers of 0.2-3.2 m, and at intervals of 3 m upward for Q. serrata and divided into stem, branches, leaves, and dead branches and leaves. Green parts of C. obtusa were categorized as leaves. Leaves of P. densiflora were easily divided from branches because sampling was conducted in August when the leaves are elongated. Coarse roots were excavated by a winch and the remained roots were dug up manually. After soil was washed away, roots were divided by the root diameter class. Because the Q. serrata tree with diameter at breast height (d.bh) = 0.341 m was multi-stemmed, d.bh and tree height (h.t) were calculated as: d.bh = 2*square root (total basal area of all stems/pi); h.t = mean height of all stems."

The ratio was estimated from subsamples taken for each component and each layer for aboveground and for each diameter class for roots. Subsamples were oven-dried at 105 degree C until there was no change in the mass. Dry mass of dead branches and leaves were not included in this data paper (see Yamaba 2007 for the dry mass for these components). For fine roots (diameter > 5 mm) that were unavailable to dug up, dry mass was estimated from the root diameter at the distal end where the roots were missing using the allometric equation log(dry mass) = a*log(D^2)+b where D is root diameter at the distal end and a and b are parameters. This equation was obtained from samples collected in the same stands as the felled trees."

Stem diameter at 0.0 and 1.3 m aboveground, stem diameter just below the lowest living branch, stem diameter at 1/10 of tree height, tree heigh, clear bole length, and crown radius in two direction were measured. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 1 m depth and separated into stem, branches, and foliage. Roots were cut into stump root and lateral roots and each was excavated by stump pulling apparatus. Most of the roots < 2 mm in diameter were torn off at pulling.

Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M.I. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M.I. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
"Yi1989","Sampling strategy","Nine trees were felled in a Pinus thunbergii forest located in Ikunomatsubara, Kyushu University Forest.  Sample trees were treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0-0.2 m, 0.2-1.2 m, and at intervals of 1 m upward. Stem, branches, and needles were separated."
"Yi1989","Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Yi1989","Height","Method not reported."
"Yi1989","Biomass","Measured fresh weight was converted to dry weight from the ratio of dry to fresh weights. Detailed method not reported."

"Yoda1978","Sampling strategy","The late Dr. Kyoji Yoda contributed largely in sampling. All large trees on the 20 m x 20 m sampling plot were cut at ground level in December 1973 (Nagano & Kira 1978). Stem diameter and tree height were measured immediately. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, 1.3-3.3 m, and at intervals of 2 m upward. Vine species, which were included in the original article, have been excluded in this compilation. Multiple-stemmed trees were also excluded for this data paper."
"Yoda1978","Leaf area","Leaf area of each layer was also estimated for each tree by the same sampling procedure, from leaf dry weight and leaf area/leaf dry weight ratios (Nagano & Kira 1978). The ratio was obtained from direct measurement of the projected leaf area of subsampled leaves with an automatic planimeter (Hayashi-Denko AAM-5). For the Abies firma tree, projected shoot silhouette area was obtained by placing shoots on the planimeter. Shoot silhouette area was assumed to be equivalent to total needle projected area for this small tree. This assumption is reasonable because a previous study showed that suppressed Abies trees have the ratio of  shoot silhouette area to needle projected area of 1-1.3 (Sprugel et al. 1996 Tree Physiol. 16:91-98)."
"Yoda1978","Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Yoda1978","Height","Measured by measuring tape after trees were cut down."
"Yoda1978","Biomass","Fresh weights of leaves, branches, and stem were measured separately for each layer and each tree. They were later converted to corresponding oven-dry weights based on smaller subsamples of respective organs taken from each layer and trees (Nagano & Kira 1978) by Dr. Yoda. Subsamples were oven-dried for 85 degreeC."
"Yoda1978","Other variables","Species name and family names were converted by M.I. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese).
