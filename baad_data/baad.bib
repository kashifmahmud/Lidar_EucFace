  abstract = {* Background and Aims Inevitable trade-offs in structure may be a basis for differentiation in plant strategies. Juvenile trees in different functional groups are characterized by specific suites of structural traits such as crown architecture and biomass distribution. The relationship between juvenile tree structure and function was tested to find out if it is robust among functionally and taxonomically similar species of the genus Shorea that coexist sympatrically in a tropical rain forest in Borneo. * Methods The sapling structures of 18 species were compared for standardized dry masses of 5 and 30 g. Pairwise simple correlation and multiple correlation patterns among structural traits of juveniles 0.1-1.5 m in height) of 18 Shorea species were examined using Pearson's correlation and principal component analysis (PCA), respectively. The correlation was then tested between the {PCA} results and three indices of shade tolerance: the net photosynthetic rate, the wood density of mature trees and seed size. * Key Results The structural variation in saplings of the genus Shorea was as large as that found in sets of species with much more diverse origins. The PCA showed that both crown architecture and allocation to leaves are major sources of variation in the structures of the 18 species investigated. Of these two axes, allocation to leaves was significantly correlated with wood density and showed a limited correlation with photosynthetic rate, whereas crown architecture was significantly correlated to seed size. * Conclusions Overall, the results suggest that an allocation trade-off between leaves and other organs, which co-varied with wood density and to a certain extent with photosynthetic capacity, accounts for the difference in shade tolerance among congeneric, functionally similar species. In contrast, the relationship between the architecture and regeneration strategy differed from the pattern found between functional groups, and the function of crown architecture was ambiguous.},

  abstract = {Question:  What environmental factors and physiological traits determine the juvenile survival rates of 11 dipterocarp species (Dipterocarpaceae) co-occurring in a Bornean tropical rain forest? \n Location:  Tropical northwestern Borneo. \m Methods:  In 248 quadrats, distributed over 12 ha, the juvenile (height< 2.0 m) survival of 11 shade-tolerant dipterocarp species was monitored for one year. The probability of survival for each species was expressed as a logistic function of plant height and three environmental factors: canopy openness, soil water potential and conspecific individual density. The correlation between survival under shaded conditions and several physiological traits of juveniles was tested by normal Pearson correlation and a phylogeny based manner using independent contrasts. \n Results:  Seven species had increased survival under more open canopies, one species had increased and two species had decreased survival at drier sites. Six species had higher survival as the density of conspecifics increased, whereas two species had lower survival. The magnitudes of the effects for the three environmental factors were similar. However, the interspecific difference in survival was largely determined by a dependence of small seedlings on the light environment. Survival under low light was correlated positively with root dry mass and negatively with total leaf area of juveniles. \n Conclusions:  Responses of seedlings to the fine-scale gradient of light availability were considerably different among the 11 species. Species that suffered increased mortality under low light had a set of structural traits that would potentially allow rapid growth under bright conditions. Differential performance along the light gradient may contribute to the stable coexistence of these species.},

Stem biomass of Cryptomeria japonica amounted to 176.8 t/ha in dry weight and 456.2 m3/ha in volume with bark. Branch was 24.5 t/ha and leaf was 23.3 t/ha. (3) The annual increment of stem of Cryptomeria japonica was determined by stem analysis and amounted to 5.35 t/ha/y in dry weight (13.8 m3/ha/y in volume). (4) Among the 7 years from 1980 to 1987, the basal area of Cryptomeria japonica increased at the average rate 0.83 m2/ha/y but the basal area of broadleaved trees decreased in 7 years by the death of suppressed trees.

We examined the relationship between genotype productivity (stem volume), whole-tree biomass partitioning, growth efficiency (stem wood production per unit leaf area), and stem {RGR} among nine different loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) genotypes from three different genetic groups of contrasting inherent genetic homogeneity: three open-pollinated (half-sib) families, three mass-control pollinated (full-sib) families, and three clonal varieties. We hypothesized that genotype productivity would be positively associated with increased partitioning to stem wood relative to other plant parts, higher stem {RGR}, and enhanced growth efficiency. After 3 years under plantation conditions, genotypes showed significant differences in stem volume, percent stem wood, percent branch wood, and partitioning to fine roots, yet no differences in stem {RGR} or growth efficiency. Furthermore, genotypic differences in stem volume were independent of genotypic differences in biomass partitioning, and overall, we found no evidence to support the hypothesized relationships. Even so, the observed variation in biomass partitioning has implications for forest C sequestration as genotypes which partition more biomass to long-lived biomass pools such as stems, may sequester more C. Moreover, the lack of a genetic relationship between stem volume and belowground partitioning suggests that highly productive genotypes may be planted without compromising belowground C storage.},

  abstract = {Abstract  A range of traits, including metabolic costs, biomass allocation and seed reserves, may contribute to interspecific variation in the shade tolerance of tree seedlings. In addition, shade tolerance may be affected by differential responses of species to soil resource availability at low light. We used a custom-built whole-plant gas-exchange chamber to quantify instantaneous whole-plant light compensation point (WPLCP) and to parameterize whole-plant daily C gain models for seedlings of eight temperate deciduous tree species. We examined the relationship of (WPLCP) to growth, biomass allocation and gas-exchange under high and low light and nutrient availabilities and compared it to {WPCLP} of naturally recruited saplings. For species showing a response, both increased light and nutrient availability resulted in increased (WPLCP). However, species' responses to resource availability did not correspond closely with shade tolerance as has generally been predicted. Variation in (WPLCP) within species was best predicted by whole-plant dark respiration rates, leaf-level light compensation point and leaf mass per area. Among species, seed size was a strong negative correlate of (WPLCP), explaining 66% of the variation. Species with the lowest (WPLCP) maintained lower growth rates across treatments but greater biomass in the low-light treatment compared with more light-demanding species. These data suggest that a number of traits, in particular metabolic costs and seed size, contribute to {WPLCP.} However, gas-exchange-based (WPLCP) was 1.5-3.5 times lower than corresponding growth-based field estimates of (WPLCP), suggesting that other factors such as biotic interactions or ontogenetic shifts in whole-plant light requirements may substantially increase species' (WPLCP) under natural conditions.},

To examine differential growth response to soil resources, we grew seedlings of nine tropical tree species at 6.0% of full sun for 12 mo in a factorial design of two soil types (clay and white sand), two phosphate fertilization treatments (control and addition of 100 mg P kg-1) and two watering treatments (field capacity and water limitation to one-third field capacity). Species differed markedly in biomass growth rate, but this hierarchy was almost completely conserved across all eight treatments. All species grew more slowly in sand than clay soils, and no species grew faster with phosphate additions. Only Eperua grandiflora and E. falcata showed significant growth increases in the absence of water limitation. Faster-growing species were characterized by high specific leaf area, high leaf allocation and high net assimilation rate but not lower root allocation. Slower-growing species exhibited greater plasticity in net assimilation rate, suggesting that tolerance of edaphic stress in these species is related more to stomatal control than to whole-plant carbon allocation. Although relative growth rate for biomass was correlated with both its physiological and morphological components, interspecific differences were best explained by differences in net assimilation rate across six of the eight treatments. A suite of traits including high assimilation and high specific leaf area maintains rapid growth rate of faster-growing species across a wide gradient of soil resources, but the lack of plasticity they exhibit may compromise their survival in the poorest soil environments.},

  abstract = {Allometric equations were developed relating aboveground biomass, coarse root biomass, and sapwood area to stem diameter at 17 study sites located in the boreal forests near Thompson, Man. The six species studied were trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP), jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), tamarack (Larix laricina (Du Roi) Koch.), and willow (Salix spp.). Stands ranged in age from 4 to 130 years and were categorized as well or poorly drained. Stem diameter ranged from 0.1 to 23.7 cm. Stem diameter was measured at both the soil surface (D0) and breast height (DBH). The relationship between biomass and diameter, fitted on a log-log scale, changed significantly at ~3 cm DBH, suggesting that allometry differed between saplings and older trees. To eliminate this nonlinearity, a model of form log10 Y = a + b(log10 D) + c(AGE) + d(log10 D * AGE) was used, where D is stem diameter, AGE is stand age, and the cross product is the interaction between diameter and age. Most aboveground biomass equations (N = 326) exhibited excellent fits (R2 > 0.95). Coarse root biomass equations (N = 205) exhibited good fits (R2 > 0.90). Both D0 and DBH were excellent (R2 > 0.95) sapwood area predictors (N = 413). Faster growing species had significantly higher ratios of sapwood area to stem area than did slower growing species. Nonlinear aspects of some of the pooled biomass equations serve as a caution against extrapolating allometric equations beyond the original sample diameter range},

All biomass distribution traits investigated varied with size, and most showed a significant interaction with both size and light, which resulted in increasing divergences among light classes as size increased. For example, the proportion of needle mass decreased as size increased but the rate of decrease was much greater in saplings growing at below 10% full sunlight. Needle area ratio (total needle area:aboveground mass) followed a similar pattern, but decreased more rapidly with increasing tree size for small trees up to 1 m tall. The proportion of needle biomass (needle mass ratio) was always lower in taller trees (i.e., > 1 m tall) than in small trees (< 1 m tall) and increasingly so at the lowest solar irradiances (0-10% full sunlight). Thus, extrapolating the functional response to light from small seedling to taller individuals is not always appropriate.},

For a given plant diameter, the pioneer species presented similar root biomass compared to the non-pioneer ones but higher cumulative root length and a higher number of root apices. A detailed study on the root system of a sub-sample of three species showed that the most late-successional species ( Tabebuia rosea ) had longer root internodes and a higher proportion of root biomass allocated to the taproot compared to the other two species ( Hura crepitans and Luehea seemannii ). Most pioneer species showed a higher leaf area ratio due to a higher specific leaf area ({SLA).} We conclude that the functional differences between pioneer and non-pioneer tree species found in natural forests were maintained in open-grown plantation conditions.},

Leaf physiological parameters were mainly influenced by the light gradient, whereas crown morphological and whole-tree allocational parameters were mainly influenced by tree size. No single physiological, morphological or allocational trait was identified that could explain the difference in shade tolerance between the species. Yellow birch had higher growth rates, biomass allocation to branches and leaf physiological plasticity and lower crown morphological plasticity in unmodified understory light than sugar maple. Sugar maple did not display significant physiological plasticity, but showed variation with tree size in both crown morphology and whole-tree biomass allocation. When sugar maple was small, a greater proportion of whole-tree biomass was allocated to roots. However, physiological differences between the species decreased with decreasing light and most morphological and allocational differences tended to disappear with increasing tree size, suggesting that many species differences in shade-tolerance are expressed mainly during the seedling stage. Understory trees of both species survived for 4 years under shade nets, possibly because of higher plasticity when small and the use of stored reserves when taller.

Specifically, understanding how foliage area ( A l ), sapwood area ( A s ), and hydraulic specific conductivity ( k s ) vary with canopy position to affect leaf-specific conductivity ({LSC)} and whole-tree leaf-specific hydraulic conductance ( K l ) may explain some of the contrasting patterns of A l / A s reported in the literature. Objective The general aim of the study was to characterize and compare the aboveground relationships between cumulative A l , A s , and k s for two Pacific Northwest coniferous species with contrasting sapwood areas to give insight into size-related design of trees for water transport through changes in {LSC} and K l . Results The 230-year-old ponderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa ) trees had slightly smaller basal diameters than the 102-year-old Douglas-fir ( Pseudostuga menziesii ) trees, but contained 85% sapwood at the base compared to 30% in Douglas-fir. At the tree base, there was no evidence that A l / A s decreased with tree age or with tree size. In both species, A l / A s of branches was significantly higher than A l / A s at the tree base, but it was not different from A l / A s measured in the trunks at the top of the tree. Douglas-fir had higher A l / A s at the base than did ponderosa pine (0.42 vs. 0.24 m 2 cm -2 ), similar patterns of change in A l / A s with height, and similar values of k s , such that {LSC} in Douglas-fir was 77% the value of {LSC} in ponderosa pine. Compensating changes to increase {LSC} between short and tall trees occurred through an increased in k s in tall trees but not through a reduction in A l . {LSC} increased logarithmically with branch path length or trunk path length whereas K l decreased significantly from top to base of old trees, but not between sections from old and young trees of similar cambial age. Conclusions Even though ponderosa pine had three times more sapwood than Douglas-fir, this study revealed a common relationship of declining K l with increasing tree height and diameter between the two species, within age classes and among trees. There was no compensating decrease in A l / A s as trees got taller, which showed that a homeostasis in K l was not maintained during growth. The trend of higher allocation of biomass to sapwood over leaves in ponderosa pine is consistent with this species' tendency to inhabit drier sites than Douglas-fir.},

  abstract = {Understanding the underlying mechanisms that account for the impact of potassium (K) fertilization and its replacement by sodium (Na) on tree growth is key to improving the management of forest plantations that are expanding over weathered tropical soils with low amounts of exchangeable bases. A complete randomized block design was planted with Eucalyptus grandis (W. Hill ex Maiden) to quantify growth, carbon uptake and carbon partitioning using a carbon budget approach. A combination of approaches including the establishment of allometric relationships over the whole rotation and measurements of soil CO2 efflux and aboveground litterfall at the end of the rotation were used to estimate aboveground net production (ANPP), total belowground carbon flux and gross primary production (GPP). The stable carbon isotope (d13C) of stem wood a-cellulose produced every year was used as a proxy for stomatal limitation of photosynthesis. Potassium fertilization increased GPP and decreased the fraction of carbon allocated belowground. Aboveground net production was strongly enhanced, and because leaf lifespan increased, leaf biomass was enhanced without any change in leaf production, and wood production (PW) was dramatically increased. Sodium application decreased the fraction of carbon allocated belowground in a similar way, and enhanced GPP, ANPP and PW, but to a lesser extent compared with K fertilization. Neither K nor Na affected d13C of stem wood a-cellulose, suggesting that water-use efficiency was the same among the treatments and that the inferred increase in leaf photosynthesis was not only related to a higher stomatal conductance. We concluded that the response to K fertilization and Na addition on PW resulted from drastic changes in carbon allocation.},

  title = {Allometric equations for young northern hardwoods: the importance of age-specific equations for estimating aboveground biomass},
  abstract = {Estimates of aboveground biomass and nutrient stocks are commonly derived using equations that describe tree dimensional relationships. Despite the widespread use of this approach, there is little information about whether equations specific to stand age are necessary for accurate biomass predictions. We developed equations for small trees (2-12 cm diameter) of six species in four young northern hardwood stands. We then compared our equations with equations used frequently in the literature that were developed in mature stands (Whittaker et al. 1974. Ecol. Monogr. 44: 233-252). Our equations for yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) predicted 11%-120% greater stem wood for individual trees compared with the equations from Whittaker et al. and, on average, 50% greater aboveground yellow birch biomass in the four stands that we studied. Differences were less pronounced for sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) and American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.); our equations predicted, on average, 9% greater aboveground stand biomass for sugar maple and 3% lower biomass for American beech compared with Whittaker et al. Our results suggest that stand age may be an important factor influencing the aboveground allometry and biomass of small yellow birch trees in these developing northern hardwood stands.},

Don) Lindl.), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.), and ponderosa pine (Pinusponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) and then estimating foliage distribution for entire crowns. Branch leaf area declined at the base of the live crown in all tree species, reinforcing the importance of accounting for branch position within the crown. Tree-level foliage distributions responded to differences in stand structure imposed by initial spacing and species composition. Foliage distribution also differed by tree social position within the stand. The effect of species composition and tree social position diminished with increasing spacing. Species with differing levels of shade tolerance can be quite plastic in the amount and vertical distribution of foliage in response to stand structure.},

  abstract = {Data on tree biomass are essential for understanding the forest carbon cycle and plant adaptations to the environment. We determined biomass accumulation and allometric relationships in the partitioning of biomass between aboveground woody biomass, leaves and roots in Nothofagus antarctica. We measured above- and belowground biomass of N. antarctica trees across different ages (5-220 years) and crown classes (dominant, codominant, intermediate and suppressed) in three site qualities. The biomass allocation patterns were studied by fitting allometric functions in biomass partitioning between leaves ({ML)}, stem and branches ({MS)} and roots ({MR).} These patterns were tested for all pooled data and according to site quality and crown classes. Biomass accumulation varied with crown class and site quality. The root component represented 26-72% of the total biomass depending on age and site. N. antarctica scaling exponents for the relationships {ML} vs. {MS}, {MA} vs. {MR}, and {MS} vs. {MR} were close to those predicted by the allometric biomass partitioning model. However, when biomass allocation was analyzed by site quality the scaling exponents varied following the optimal partitioning theory which states that plants should allocate more biomass to the part of the plant that acquires the most limiting resource. In contrast, the crown class effect on biomass partitioning was almost negligible. In conclusion, to obtain accurate estimations of biomass in N. antarctica trees the allometric approach appears as an useful tool but the site quality should be taken into consideration.},

Consequently, we quantified the interactive effects of growth [CO2] and temperature on photosynthesis of faster-growing Eucalyptus saligna and slower-growing E. sideroxylon. Well-watered and -fertilized tree seedlings were grown in a glasshouse at three atmospheric [CO2] (290, 400, and 650 yL/L), and ambient (26/18 degC, day/night) and high (ambient + 4 degC) air temperature. Despite differences in growth rate, both eucalypts responded similarly to [CO2] and temperature treatments with few interactive effects. Light-saturated photosynthesis (Asat) and light- and [CO2]-saturated photosynthesis (Amax) increased by ~50% and ~10%, respectively, with each step-increase in growth [CO2], underpinned by a corresponding 6-11% up-regulation of maximal electron transport rate (Jmax). Maximal carboxylation rate (Vcmax) was not affected by growth [CO2]. Thermal photosynthetic acclimation occurred such that Asat and Amax were similar in ambient- and high-temperature-grown plants. At high temperature, the thermal optimum of Asat increased by 2-7 degC across [CO2] treatments. These results are the first to suggest that photosynthesis of well-watered and -fertilized eucalypt seedlings will remain strongly responsive to increasing atmospheric [CO2] in a future, warmer climate.},

Eucalyptus microcarpa. a commonly occurring tree in the Victorian and New South Wales Riverina. While usually having a single trunk, a significant proportion of grey box individuals have multiple stems from near the ground. This is an artifact of enhanced epicormic growth when juvenile, often resulting from stock grazing disturbance. The procedure treats each stem formed from below 30 cm above ground as a discrete tree that shares a proportion of the butt and other elements common to all stems. Significant allometric relationships, using both the commonly-applied log-transformed method, and a recently proposed additive error method, were developed between stem diameter at breast height and at 30 cm above ground, tree height and width, and the dry weights of each aboveground component. These relationships were similar to those previously obtained for single-stemmed trees in southern Australia. },

Whether this plasticity in tree shape varies between species in relation to their light requirement is unknown. We purposefully sampled 528 trees ranging 5-100 cm diameter at breast height growing in a range of light conditions. Across ten broad-leaved species observed in Sumatra or Kalimantan, a generic relationship was found between light exposure of the crown and a light-dependent a l parameter that modifies the height-diameter allometric equation ( H = a l D b ) from those for closed stands. In our results, vertical stretching is well predicted by light availability. In fully open conditions, trees are on average 31% shorter for the same diameter than under (partial) shade. Most of the stretching response occurs in all species as soon as some degree of lateral shading occurs. The response, however, varies by species (8-44% reduction) in a way apparently unrelated to species' successional status. Crown volume varied less than stem height in its relationship with stem diameter across all light conditions tested. The scaling of crown volume with stem diameter, however, differed markedly between tree species.},

  abstract = {Leaves are the key active sites for energy and matter transfer in plants, and therefore the total one-sided area of leaves per square metre of ground (leaf area index, LAI) is a critical variable used for scaling up from plant to ecosystem level properties. A commonly held belief is that LAI remains constant during the self-thinning phase of stand development, and allometric relationships between tree density, mean tree size and leaf area (or leaf mass) are frequently used to provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed thinning relationships. We investigated variations in leaf allometry, stand LAI and other canopy properties along a developmental sequence of naturally occurring mono-specific self-thinning stands of mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) in New Zealand. Stand age had a consistent significant effect on both the slope and the intercept of both the leaf mass and the leaf area allometric relationships (increasing slope, decreasing intercept). This was due to trees of a given basal area having more leaf area (or leaf mass) when growing in a neighbourhood of smaller trees, than equivalently sized individuals surrounded by a lower density of trees larger than itself. A peaked (non-constant) relationship was observed between LAI and stand age during self-thinning, with the mean LAI values peaking in intermediately aged large sapling stands (7.08) compared with the small sapling stands (5.42) and older pole stands (5.70). Stand level leaf mass per unit area (LMA) varied with canopy height and stand age, being highest at the top of canopies and in older stands. We propose that the observed increase in canopy depth during the early stages of stand development (but after canopy closure has occurred) could be driving the increase in stand LAI due to a more even distribution of light within the canopy. Our findings suggest that the commonly held assumption of constant LAI should be abandoned in favour of the notion of leaf area being at a dynamic maximum during self-thinning, with the maximum possible leaf area being influenced by age-related changes in canopy structure that occur during stand development.},

Data were measured in 30-year-old birch monocultures of three different initial spacings. As suggested by the pipe model, there was a strong linear correlation between the total cross-sectional area of branches and that of stem at crown base. Foliage mass correlated with stem basal area at crown base. An allometric relationship was found between foliage mass and crown length, and the mean length (weighted by basal area) of branches correlated linearly with crown length. Pipe ratios of branches and foliage were found to be independent of slenderness (= tree height / breast height diameter). The proportion of stem in aboveground biomass increased from 80% to 96% when the slenderness index increased, the proportions of branches and leaves decreasing, respectively. For crown biomass, the proportion of foliage was greater in the more slender stems, accompanied with a corresponding decrease in the proportion of stems, while the share of branches remained rather constant. The ratio of productive (foliage) and nonproductive (stem plus branches) biomass inside the crown was positively correlated with slenderness, but in the whole tree, the ratio declined with increasing slenderness. The results of this study support the theory of functional balance and seem to be in conflict with the priority principle of allocation.},

Crown ratio and crown length varied between age groups and treatments. Crown width was positively correlated with crown length, but branch length along the crown depended on tree age and growing space. Foliage mass density peaked at a relative crown height of 50-70% in middle-aged and mature stands, while young crowns were densest and widest at the base. Foliage mass was predictable from branch and stem cross-sectional area, provided the distance from the top was included. The ratio of foliage mass to branch cross-sectional area increased for 2-4 m down from the tip of the crown, then started to decrease. The relationship between cumulative foliage mass and stem cross-sectional area was non-linear along the stem in the upper crown, but the ratio of cumulative branch to stem cross-sectional area was linear. Trees in the mature and unthinned stands had more cross-sectional area in branches relative to stems than in the young and thinned stands. We conclude that the profile theory needs modification regarding (1) crown shape which varies with age and growing space, and (2) the ratio of foliage mass to branch area which varies along the stem. Both aspects emphasise the need to include impacts of disuse of sapwood pipes in models of crown and stem development.},

The coefficients of correlation for the obtained allometric relationships between tree diameter and plant-part biomass showed high values, ranging from 0.83 to 0.99. In addition, there were few interspecific differences in relationships for all biomass parts, except for leaves. We also found relatively high coefficients of allometric relationships between tree height and plant-part biomass ranging from 0.83 to 0.94. Comparison of above- and below-ground biomass equations for various tropical rainforests implies that our allometric equations differ largely from the equations for tropical primary forests. Thus, choosing both above- and below-ground allometric equations for biomass estimation in tropical secondary forests of South-East Asia requires careful consideration of their suitability.},

  abstract = {Although allometric equations can be used to accurately estimate biomass and/or carbon stock in forest ecosystems, few have been developed for logged-over tropical rainforests in Southeast Asia. We developed allometric relationships between tree size variables (stem diameter at breast height (dbh) and tree height) and leaf, branch, stem and total above-ground biomass in two logged-over tropical rainforests with different soil conditions in Sarawak, Malaysia. The study sites were originally classified as mainly lowland dipterocarp forest and have been selectively logged in the past 20 years. In total, 30 individuals from 27 species were harvested to measure above-ground parts. The correlation coefficients for the allometric relationships obtained for total above-ground biomass as a function of dbh had high values (0.99), although the relationships for leaf biomass had a relatively low coefficient (0.83). We also found relatively high coefficients for allometric relationships between tree height and plant-part biomass, ranging from 0.82 to 0.97. Moreover, there were no differences for allometric equations of total above-ground biomass between study sites. A comparison of equations of above-ground biomass in various previously reported tropical rainforests and pan-tropic general equations imply that our allometric equations differ largely from the equations for tropical primary forests, early successional secondary forest, and even for the general models. Therefore, choosing the biomass estimation models for above-ground biomass in the logged-over forests of Southeast Asia requires careful consideration of their suitability.},

  abstract = {Leaf spacing and aboveground growth were monitored in saplings of ten species in a range of light environments in a Panamanian lowland humid forest. One- to 2-m-tall individuals of the chosen species had intermediate to large leaves on stems with few or no branches. Saplings in high light environments grew faster in height and produced more biomass per unit leaf area than shaded saplings for all species. These growth responses involved morphological plasticity with greater extension per unit biomass increment increasing the height growth rate of gap-grown saplings and greater biomass allocation to leaves decreasing the whole plant light compensation point in shade. The relative performance of the species also varied across the light gradient and was related to differences in leaf lifespan and specific leaf mass. Light-demanding species grew as rapidly in shade as shade-tolerant species, but the shorter leaf lifespan of the former necessitates higher production rates to maintain a given leaf area, largely excluding light-demanders from shaded understory locations. Height growth rate was positively correlated with leaf spacing for each species, and differences between species in the height growth rate-internode length relationship were related to interspecific differences in specific leaf mass. Thus, sapling growth histories may be inferred from their morphologies.},

Considerable diversity was found in the architecture of branching and in the leaf size of saplings. The differences in branching and leaf size were related to differences in allometric relationships between various properties of the saplings. It was hypothesized that this architectural and allometric diversity is related to the alternative of `choosing' either the pattern of assimilate allocation, which is adaptive in competition when there is an early improvement in light conditions, or the allocation pattern which is favourable for surviving long periods under persistently dark conditions. Measurements of sapling growth in closed stands and in gaps supported the hypothesis.},

Saplings of emergent Swintonia schwenkii Teijsm. \& Binn. ex Hook. f. favoured height growth rather than expansion of assimilative area. Trends of interspecific differences in sapling allometry in tropical rain forest were similar to those in warm-temperate rain forest. Tropical saplings had more slender trunks and greater total leaf area at a given height than warm-temperate saplings, but dry weight proportions among organs were similar.

  abstract = {1. A comparative study has been made of the allometric relationships among below-ground and above-ground dimensions of seedlings (6.5-27 cm tall) of 14 abundant shade-tolerant species taken from the forest floor in a warm-temperate rain forest on Yakushima Island, southern Japan. 2. The allometric lines between below-ground dimensions are significantly different between species, which reflects the differentiation between the species developing tap-roots and those developing horizontal fine roots in the same forest. The difference correlates with a difference in seed size, but not with height at maturity or habitat (ridge vs slope or gully). It is hypothesized that the differences in root architecture are related to 'choices' in microsite for establishment, the large-seeded tap-rooted species being better suited to soft soil and deep litter, and the small-seeded lateral rooters to rocky soil and a lack of litter. 3. The allometric relationship relating below- and above-ground dry mass is not sufficient to characterize a species' architecture; a species may have a large ratio of root mass to shoot mass but a low ratio of fine-root length to leaf area. 4. Interspecific differentiation in below-ground allometries at the seedling stage is not correlated with that in above-ground allometries at the seedling stage or with that in above-ground allometries at the sapling stage with developed branching architecture. Allometric 'design' in architecture at the sapling stage (related to earlier or later canopy-gap formation) is variously combined with that at the seedling stage (related to the microsite of establishment).},

  abstract = {The leaf area index (LAI) of fast-growing Eucalyptus plantations is highly dynamic both seasonally and inter-annually, and is spatially variable depending on pedo-climatic conditions. LAI is very important in determining the carbon and water balance of a stand, but is difficult to measure during a complete stand rotation and at large scales. Remote-sensing methods allowing the retrieval of {LAI} time series with accuracy and precision are therefore necessary. Here, we tested two methods for LAI estimation from MODIS 250m resolution red and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance time series. The first method involved the inversion of a coupled model of leaf reflectance and transmittance (PROSPECT4), soil reflectance (SOILSPECT) and canopy radiative transfer (4SAIL2). Model parameters other than the LAI were either fixed to measured constant values, or allowed to vary seasonally and/or with stand age according to trends observed in field measurements. The LAI was assumed to vary throughout the rotation following a series of alternately increasing and decreasing sigmoid curves. The parameters of each sigmoid curve that allowed the best fit of simulated canopy reflectance to MODIS red and NIR reflectance data were obtained by minimization techniques. The second method was based on a linear relationship between the LAI and values of the GEneralized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (GESAVI), which was calibrated using destructive LAI measurements made at two seasons, on Eucalyptus stands of different ages and productivity levels. The ability of each approach to reproduce field-measured LAI values was assessed, and uncertainty on results and parameter sensitivities were examined. Both methods offered a good fit between measured and estimated LAI (R2=0.80 and R2=0.62 for model inversion and GESAVI-based methods, respectively), but the GESAVI-based method overestimated the LAI at young ages.},

  abstract = {Climate change may alter forest composition by differentially affecting the responses of faster- and slower-growing tree species to drought. However, the combined effects of rising atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) and temperature on drought responses of trees are poorly understood. Here, we examined interactive effects of temperature (ambient, ambient oC) and [CO2] (290, 400 and 650mu;l l-1) on drought responses of Eucalyptus saligna Sm. (faster-growing) and E. sideroxylon A. Cunn. ex Woolls (slower-growing) seedlings. Drought was imposed via a controlled reduction in soil water over 1-2 weeks, re-watering seedlings when leaves visibly wilted. In ambient temperature, the effect of drought on the light-saturated net photosynthetic rate (Asat) in E. saligna decreased as [CO2] increased from pre-industrial to future concentrations, but rising [CO2] did not affect the response in Eucalyptus sideroxylon. In contrast, elevated temperature exacerbated the effect of drought in reducing Asat in both species. The drought response of Asat reflected changes in stomatal conductance (gs) associated with species and treatment differences in (i) utilization of soil moisture and (ii) leaf area ratio (leaf area per unit plant dry mass). Across [CO2] and temperature treatments, E. saligna wilted at higher soil water potentials compared with E. sideroxylon. Photosynthetic recovery from drought was 90% complete 2 days following re-watering across all species and treatments. Our results suggest that E. saligna (faster-growing) seedlings are more susceptible to drought than E. sideroxylon (slower-growing) seedlings. The greater susceptibility to drought of E. saligna reflected faster drawdown of soil moisture, associated with more leaf area and leaf area ratio, and the ability of E. sideroxylon to maintain higher gs at a given soil moisture. Inclusion of a pre-industrial [CO2] treatment allowed us to conclude that susceptibility of these species to short-term drought under past and future climates may be regulated by the same mechanisms. Further, the beneficial effects of rising [CO2] and deleterious effects of elevated temperature on seedling response to drought were generally offsetting, suggesting susceptibility of seedlings of these species to short-term drought in future climates that is similar to pre-industrial and current climate conditions.},

  abstract = {Most knowledge of the physiological correlates of interspecific variation in shade tolerance derives from studies of first-year seedlings in artificial environments. The present study relates growth, allocation, foliage turnover, biomass distribution and gas exchange traits to low-light survival of large seedlings (20-100 cm tall) of eight temperate rainforest evergreens under field conditions. Taxa for which natural mortality was not observed in low light during the 14-month study are referred to here as {"}shade-tolerant{"} species, and those which did die in the shade are referred to as {"}light-demanding{"} species. In low light (2-5% canopy openness), shade-tolerant species had slightly lower light compensation points than light-demanders. Light-demanding species had more plastic aboveground allocation patterns, generally allocating proportionally less aboveground biomass to foliage production than shade-tolerant associates in high light (>10% canopy openness), but more in low light. Foliage turnover was generally much slower in shade-tolerant species (10-40% year-1) than in light-demanding species (30-190%). As these differences in leaf retention outweighed variation in allocation, shade-tolerant species displayed higher leaf areas at all light levels. Furthermore, all shade-tolerant species gained leaf area in low light during the study period, whereas light-demanding taxa showed leaf area declines. Higher leaf area ratios, plus differences in light compensation points, indicate that large seedlings of shade-tolerant evergreens enjoy net carbon gain advantages over light-demanding associates in low light. However, minimal growth rate differences in low light imply higher storage allocation in shade-tolerant species. This study provides a rather different picture from that which has emerged from recent reviews of first-year seedling data, illustrating the longterm consequences of foliage turnover differences for biomass distribution, and suggesting that shade tolerance in juvenile evergreen trees is associated with a suite of traits which enhance net carbon gain, but not growth, in low light. Accumulation of a large foliage area through long leaf retention times is probably a key mechanism enhancing low-light carbon gain in evergreens.},

  abstract = {{1 Interspecific} variation in leaf life span of woody plants should have important consequences for ontogenetic variation in biomass distribution, and hence carbon balance, in low light. This proposal was examined by measuring foliage turnover, growth, biomass allocation and biomass distribution of juveniles (25-1180 mm tall) of four evergreens differing in shade tolerance, growing in low light (2-5% canopy openness) in temperate rainforest understoreys in south-central {Chile. 2 As} predicted, ontogenetic trends in leaf area ratio ({LAR)} of two very shade-tolerant species with long-lived leaves (Aextoxicon punctatum and Myrceugenia planipes) contrasted strongly with those of mid-tolerant Eucryphia cordifolia and intolerant Aristotelia chilensis. Low-light {LAR} fell rapidly with increasing plant size in Eucryphia and Aristotelia, but was size-invariant in the two shade-tolerant taxa. As a result, although small seedlings of Eucryphia and Aristotelia displayed more leaf area than shade-tolerant seedlings of similar size (largely because of differences in specific leaf area), this relationship was reversed for plants over ~500 mm {tall. 3 Although} the slower foliage turnover of the shade-tolerant species at least partly explains this reversal, allocational differences may also be involved. Root mass fraction of both shade-tolerant species was significantly negatively correlated with size, possibly reflecting declining allocation to roots in larger plants. In contrast, root mass fraction was not correlated with size in Eucryphia or {Aristotelia. 4 Above-ground} relative growth rate in low light followed similar ontogenetic trends to {LAR}, declining more quickly in light-demanding species than in shade-tolerant associates. As a result, large seedlings (>400 mm tall) of shade-tolerant Myrceugenia and Aextoxicon grew more quickly than their light-demanding associates at the same height. The steeply declining {LAR} and growth of Eucryphia and Aristotelia suggest that these taxa will eventually die of energy starvation in low {light. 5 Results} are consistent with the idea that accumulation of an extensive leaf area eventually gives juvenile shade-tolerant evergreens a net carbon gain advantage over their light-demanding associates in low light. Awareness of long-term ontogenetic trends will enhance understanding of relationships of shade-tolerance variation with morphology and growth of woody evergreens.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims A long-running debate centres on whether shade tolerance of tree seedlings is mainly a function of traits maximizing net carbon gain in low light, or of traits minimizing carbon loss. To test these alternatives, leaf display, light-interception efficiency, and simulated net daily carbon gain of juvenile temperate evergreens of differing shade tolerance were measured, and how these variables are influenced by ontogeny was queried.\n Methods The biomass distribution of juveniles (17-740 mm tall) of seven temperate rainforest evergreens growing in low (approx. 4 %) light in the understorey of a second-growth stand was quantified. Daytime and night-time gas exchange rates of leaves were also determined, and crown architecture was recorded digitally. YPLANT was used to model light interception and carbon gain. \n Results An index of species shade tolerance correlated closely with photosynthetic capacities and respiration rates per unit mass of leaves, but only weakly with respiration per unit area. Accumulation of many leaf cohorts by shade-tolerant species meant that their ratios of foliage area to biomass (LAR) decreased more gradually with ontogeny than those of light-demanders, but also increased self-shading; this depressed the foliage silhouette-to-area ratio (STAR), which was used as an index of light-interception efficiency. As a result, displayed leaf area ratio (LARd = LAR * STAR) of large seedlings was not related to species shade tolerance. Self-shading also caused simulated net daily carbon assimilation rates of shade-tolerant species to decrease with ontogeny, leading to a negative correlation of shade tolerance with net daily carbon gain of large (500 mm tall) seedlings in the understorey. \nConclusions The results suggest that efficiency of energy capture is not an important correlate of shade tolerance in temperate rainforest evergreens. Ontogenetic increases in self-shading largely nullify the potential carbon gain advantages expected to result from low respiration rates and long leaf lifespans in shade-tolerant evergreens. The main advantage of their long-lived leaves is probably in reducing the costs of crown maintenance.

  doi = {10.1093/aob/mcs095},
  abstract = {Background and aims The contemporary relegation of conifers mainly to cold or infertile sites has been ascribed to low competitive ability, as a result of the hydraulic inefficiency of tracheids and their seedlings' initial dependence on small foliage areas. We tested the hypothesis that, in temperate rainforests, the larger leaves of angiosperms also reduce self-shading and thus enable display of larger effective foliage areas than the numerous small leaves of conifers. \n Methods We tested this hypothesis using {YPLANT} and structural equation modelling to compare self-shading and light interception potential of seedlings of six conifers and 12 angiosperm trees from temperate rainforests. The ratio of displayed leaf area to plant mass ({LARd)} was used to indicate plant light interception potential: {LARd} is the product of specific leaf area, leaf mass fraction, self-shading and leaf angle. \n Results Angiosperm seedlings self-shaded less than conifers, mainly because of differences in leaf number (more than leaf size), and on average their {LARd} was about twice that of conifers. Although specific leaf area was the most pervasive influence on {LARd}, differences in self-shading also contributed significantly in large seedlings. \n onclusions The ability to deploy foliage in relatively few, large leaves is advantageous in minimizing self-shading, and enhancing seedling light interception potential per unit of plant biomass. This study adds significantly to evidence that vegetative traits may be at least as important as reproductive innovations in explaining the success of angiosperms in productive environments where vegetation is structured by light competition.},

  abstract = {* It is widely believed that species sorting on environmental gradients reflects trade-offs between competitive ability and physiological tolerance of stresses such as frost and desiccation. One specific expression of this general idea is the hypothesis that tree species sorting on temperature gradients in temperate regions involves a trade-off between growth rate and frost resistance, because adaptations to frost reduce light interception and carbon gain potential. * We measured seedling growth of 17 New Zealand rain forest angiosperm trees in a glasshouse, as well as biomass partitioning, gas exchange and hydraulic traits. We then related these variables to the mean July (winter) minimum temperatures most frequently experienced throughout the range of each species. * Species associated with mild winters on average had wider vessels and more conductive stems and were leafier (i.e. developed more foliage area per unit sapwood area) than species from frostier sites. Species' positions on the temperature gradient were not significantly correlated with relative growth rates of seedlings; they were, however, negatively correlated with two measures of species light requirements in the field: the light compensation point for growth, and low-light mortality rates obtained from the literature. * Synthesis. Although seedling growth rates of warm- and cool-temperate New Zealand angiosperm trees were similar on average, the former are more shade tolerant. Competitive hierarchies associated with tree species sorting on temperature gradients thus probably involve a shift in the relationship between shade tolerance and growth rate, rather than a simple trade-off of growth with cold tolerance. This shift is associated with variation in light interception potential per unit of seedling biomass, possibly reflecting a trade-off between stem conductivity and resistance to freeze-thaw embolism.},

A model that included variables representing tree size (or relative social position) and degree of past suppression (live branch whorls per unit crown length) indicated that stem volume growth first increased but later decreased over leaf area when other variables were held constant. Growth efficiency declined with increasing tree leaf area, although greater height and diameter enhanced growth efficiency and greater past suppression diminished growth efficiency.

	* 1 Water availability is the main determinant of species' distribution in lowland tropical forests. Species' occurrence along water availability gradients depends on their ability to tolerate drought.
	* 2 To identify species' traits underlying drought-tolerance we excavated first year seedlings of 62 dry and moist forest tree species at the onset of the dry season. We evaluate how morphological seedling traits differ between forests, and whether functional groups of species can be identified based on trait relations. We also compare seedling traits along independent axes of drought and shade-tolerance to assess a hypothesized trade-off.
	* 3 Seedlings of dry forest species improve water foraging capacity in deep soil layers by an increased below-ground biomass allocation and by having deep roots. They minimize the risk of cavitation by making dense stems, and reduce transpiration by producing less leaf tissue. Moist forest seedlings have large leaf areas and a greater above-ground biomass, to maximize light interception, and long, cheap, branched root systems, to increase water and nutrient capture.
	* 4 Associations among seedling traits reveal three major drought strategies: (i) evergreen drought-tolerant species have high biomass investment in enduring organs, minimize cavitation and minimize transpiration to persist under dry conditions; (ii) drought-avoiding species maximize resource capture during a limited growing season and then avoid stress with a deciduous leaf habit in the dry season; (iii) drought-intolerant species maximize both below- and above-ground resource capture to increase competitiveness for light, but are consequently precluded from dry habitats.
	* 5 We found no direct trade-off between drought- and shade-tolerance, because they depend largely on different morphological adaptations. Drought-tolerance is supported by a high biomass investment to the root system, whereas shade-tolerance is mainly promoted by a low growth rate and low SLA.
	* 6 Synthesis. We conclude that there are three general adaptation strategies of drought-tolerance, which seemingly hold true across biomes and for different life forms. Drought- and shade-tolerance are largely independent from one another, suggesting a high potential for niche differentiation, as species' specialization can occur at different combinations of water and light availability.},

Scaling of stem conductivity (Kh) with stem diameter was used to model the hydraulic conductance of the stem network. * {* Ring-porous} trees showed the steepest increase in Kh with stem size. Temperate diffuse-porous trees were at the opposite extreme, and conifers and tropical diffuse-porous species were intermediate. Scaling of Kh was influenced by differences in the allometry of conduit diameter (taper) and packing (number per wood area) with stem size. * {* The} Kh trends were mirrored by the modeled stem-network conductances. Ring-porous species had the greatest network conductance and this value increased isometrically with trunk basal area, indicating that conductance per unit sapwood was independent of tree size. Conductances were lowest and most size-dependent in conifers. The results indicate that differences in conduit taper and packing between functional types propagate to the network level and have an important influence on metabolic scaling concepts.},

Baker, sapwood area (As) to foliage area (Af) ratios ({As:Af)} decreased as tree height increased, contradicting the common interpretation of the Pipe Model Theory as well as the generally observed trend of increasing {As:Af} ratios with tree height. To clarify this relationship, we estimated sapwood hydraulic conductivity theoretically based on measurements of sapwood vessel diameters and Poiseuille's law for fluid flow through pipes. Despite the observed decrease in {As:Af} ratios with tree height, leaf specific conductivity increased with total tree height, largely as a result of an increase in the specific conductivity of sapwood. This observation supports the proposition that the stem's ability to supply foliage with water must increase as trees grow taller, to compensate for the increased hydraulic path length. The results presented here highlight the importance of measuring sapwood hydraulic conductivity in analyses of sapwood-foliage interactions, and suggest that measurements of sapwood hydraulic conductivity may help to resolve conflicting observations of how {As:Af} ratios change as trees grow taller.},

Whole crowns were weighed fresh in the field by crown quarter. Two antithetic random branches were sampled from each crown quarter, weighed fresh in the field, and returned to the laboratory for detailed analysis. Nonlinear weighted regression with the general allometric equation was used to estimate all parameters. For the branches, branch diameter and length, foliated length, and position in the crown explain 82-97% of the variation. Specific leaf area (leaf area/mass) differs significantly among species and increases with distance from the tree top. For whole trees, sapwood area at breast height, crown ratio and length, and crown competition factor (CCF) explain 94-99% of the variation. The assumption of linearity and constant ratio between leaf area and sapwood area held rather generally. Differences between two alternative estimators (branch summation vs. crown weighing) of total crown biomass and leaf area were not statistically significant. For stands, stand totals were estimated from the whole-tree equations and stand-inventory data.

Crown profile of foliage area fitted well with the Weibull distribution. The crown profile tended to be more skewed toward the top of crowns in smaller trees than in larger trees. This tendency was reflected in the value of the shape parameter of the Weibull distribution. The shape parameter ranged from 1.73 to 3.23 and gradually increased up to an asymptotic value with an increase of stem diameter at breast height. The scale parameter of the distribution ranged from 1.0 to 4.2 and tended to increase in proportion to stem diameter at breast height. Foliage area of a tree correlated well with stem diameter at breast height through an ordinary allometric equation. Tree height could be approximated fairly well by a generalized allometric equation as a function of stem diameter at breast height. On the basis of the census of stem diameter at breast height, canopy profile could be constructed synthesizing crown profiles of foliage area for individual trees in the stand.

I found that (1) out of the original 200 seedlings, 58 survived after one-year with lacebark elm ( Ulmus parrifolia ), osage orange ( Maclura pomifera ), and eastern redbud ( Cercis canadensis ) surviving the most and protection from herbivores increasing survivorship by more than an order of magnitude, (2) elm ( Ulmus parrifolia ) showed the slowest stem growth but protection from herbivory increased stem growth rate by approximately 50%, leaf area ratio was largest for elm ( Ulmus parrifolia ) but seedlings growing in sumac ( Rhus copallina ) patches had the smallest values, specific leaf area was the largest for orange ( Maclura pomifera ) seedlings with tree seedlings growing in grass patches showing greater values than those grown in other patches, and (3) leaf mass ratio was largest for elm ( Ulmus parrifolia ) with seedlings grown in sumac ( Rhus copallina ) patches showing the smallest values and rough-leaf dogwood ( Cornus drummondii ) had the most root biomass relative to shoot biomass compared to all other species.

Using mass and volume conversions from harvested trees (15 dominant and 15 suppressed), we developed regressions to predict total and component biomass from DBH. Bole, branch, needle, and total mass differed between dominance categories (ANCOVA, P < 0.10). For a representative size (15 cm DBH), dominant trees allocated 63.4, 13.2, 11.3, and 12.0% of biomass to bole, branch, needle, and root tissue compared with 75.9, 6.7, 5.6, and 11.7% for suppressed trees. At any given DBH, suppressed trees were also taller than dominant trees and had a greater porportion of heterotrophic (bole plus branch plus root mass) to autotrophic (needle mass) tissue. Percent carbon and nitrogen of tissues did not differ between dominance categories. Unlike the increased investment in leaf area observed for seedlings and saplings of shade-tolerant species, suppressed loblolly pine increased allocation to bole mass and height growth. An increase in height for this shade-intolerant species may enable some suppressed individuals to escape competition for light. However, increased allocation to heterotrophic versus autotrophic tissue in suppressed trees may confer a cumulative disadvantage over time because of increased respiratory load.},

Both individual tree-based models and other forest process-based models are generally highly sensitive to this parameter, but information on its temporal or within-stand variability is still scarce. In a 2-4-year-old Eucalyptus plantation in Congo, prone to seasonal drought, the within-stand and seasonal variability in SLA were investigated by means of destructive sampling carried out at 2-month intervals, over a 2-year period. Within-crown vertical gradients of SLA were small. Highly significant relationships were found between tree-average SLA (SLAt) and tree size (tree height, Ht, or diameter at breast height, DBH): SLAt ranged from about 9 m2/kg for dominant trees to about 14-15 m2/kg for the smallest trees. The decrease in SLAt with increasing tree size was accurately predicted from DBH using power functions. Stand-average SLA varied by about 20% during the year, with lowest values at the end of the 5-month dry season, and highest values about 2-3 months after the onset of the wet season. Variability in leaf water status according to tree size and season is discussed as a possible determinant of both the within-stand and seasonal variations in SLA.},

Stand structure suggests that the forests were still recovering from the impacts of cyclone Tracy and subsequent frequent fires. Eucalyptus miniata and E. tetrodonta were significant contributors to overstorey leaf area index and standing biomass (>70%), and both leaf area index and biomass were strongly correlated to basal area. Leaf area index was at a maximum (about 1.0) at the end of the wet season and declined over the dry season by about 30-40%. There were proportionally greater changes in the understorey reflecting the greater contribution of deciduous and semi-deciduous species in this strata. Standing biomass was about 55t/ha .

Fifteen trees ages 3–36 years were dissected to develop leaf area predictions from sapwood cross-sectional area. Tree leaf area and LAI were estimated from three plots per spacing for nine spacing treatments ranging from 2.1 to 6.1 m. Crown width and crown length measurements at 10, 16, and 22 years were used to assess crown architecture. Tree leaf area was greatest at low densities. LAI increased with age through age 22 but did not display patterns of convergence to a common LAI level. Higher stand densities reached a maximum LAI of about 7.0. Low stand densities reached LAIs of 2 to 3 and showed no trends toward the maximum through age 22. Crown architecture apparently limits leaf area development. Sequoia has a narrow crown form with crown length to crown width ratios over 3.0 at age 22. At young ages, a crown architecture limitation prevents attainment of maximum LAI at lower densities. Trends in crown shape and leaf area density indicate lower densities will not reach maximum LAI for many decades if at all.},

Leaf morphology was compared between the harvested and litter leaves for trees of various heights. Also, litter traps were set systematically around the trees of various heights, and distribution patterns were investigated for litter leaves. Leaf area and dry weight decreased with increasing height in a similar manner in both leaf litter and harvested leaves. This suggests that median crown height can be estimated from mean area or mass of the leaf litter of a tree in this species. Furthermore, horizontal distribution patterns of litter leaves were well explained by the Gaussian kernel. Leaf fall rate was estimated to be 2.0--28.1\&\#xa0;kg per tree per year in the five trees of various heights, and was greater in taller trees. Since leaf life span was smaller for taller trees, leaf biomass was estimated to be 2.6--30.5\&\#xa0;kg per tree, and was also greater in taller trees. These estimated values are similar to the values estimated from the allometric equation that uses the diameter at breast height and overall tree height as parameters.},

These trends failed to emerge in across-species comparisons and were reversed at a common (low) height. Across species, the relative crown depth decreased with maximum potential height and was indistinguishable at a common (low) height. Crown architectural traits influence {SSF} more than structural property of wood density. These findings emphasize the importance of applying a common reference size in comparative studies and suggest that forest trees (especially the understory group) may adapt to low light by having deeper rather than wider crowns due to an efficient distribution and geometry of their foliage.},

Under low light conditions, maple and ash showed a slight lead in recent annual length increment compared with beech. With increasing light, ash and maple constantly gained superiority in length increment, whereas beech approached an asymptotic value above 35% light. A suite of architectural and leaf morphological attributes indicated a more pronounced ability of beech to adapt to shade than ash and maple. Beech displayed its leaves along the entire tree height (with a concentration in the middle crown), yielding a higher live crown ratio than ash and maple. It allocated biomass preferentially to radial growth which resulted in low height to diameter ratios, and expressed marked plagiotropic growth in shade indicating a horizontal light-foraging strategy. In addition, beech exhibited the highest specific leaf area, a greater total leaf area per unit tree height, a slightly greater leaf area index, and a greater plasticity to light in total leaf area. Ash and maple presented a {"}gap species{"} growth strategy, characterized by a marked and constant response in growth rates to increasing light and an inability to strongly reduce their growth rates in deep shade. In shade, they showed some plasticity in displaying most of their leaf area at the top of the crown to minimize self-shading and to enhance light interception. Through this, particularly, maple developed an {"}umbrella{"} like crown. These species-specific responses may be used for controlling the development of mixed-species regeneration in shelterwood systems.},

Most plant variables showed strong ontogenetic changes; they were highly dependent on the biomass of the plant. 3. Growth rate was highest at intermediate fight levels (25-50%) above which it declined. Most plant variables showed a curvilinear response to irradiance, with the largest changes at the lowest Light levels. 4. There was a consistent ranking in growth between species; species that were fast growing in a low-light environment were also fast growing in a high-light environment. 5. At low light, interspecific variation in relative growth rate was determined mainly by differences in a morphological trait, the leaf area ratio (LAR), whereas at high light it was determined mainly by differences in a physiological trait, the net assimilation rate (NAR). 6. NAR became a stronger determinant of growth than LAR in more than 10-15% daylight. As light availability in the forest is generally much lower than this threshold level, it follows that interspecific variation in growth in a forest environment is mainly owing to variation in morphology. },

Dry mass weighted average nitrogen ({NW)} and phosphorus ({PW)} contents were higher in P. sylvestris in sand dunes than in those in the raised bog, but {PW/NW} ratios overlapped between the sites.

First-year seedlings were grown at four irradiance and four N and P availability combinations, and the experiment was repeated in two consecutive years. In both species, increases in light availability resulted in larger net assimilation rate ({NAR}, total plant biomass production rate per unit leaf area), root mass fraction ({FR)} and leaf mass per unit area ({MA)}, but reductions in leaf area ratio ({LAR}, foliage area per total plant dry mass), stem mass fraction ({FS)} and leaf mass fraction ({FL).} The strong decrease in {LAR} ({LAR\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;FL/MA)} with light mainly resulted from increases in {MA.} The light-dependent increase in {NAR} was larger than the decline in {LAR} such that plant relative growth rate ({RGR\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;NAR\&\#xa0;*\&\#xa0;LAR)} scaled positively with light in both species.

Leaf area index (LAI), hydraulic characteristics, and needle nutrient concentrations were also measured. Volume growth of P site trees between 1994 and 1999 was 46% that of M site trees. Volume growth was closely associated with both hydraulic supply capacity (Q) and leaf area. Height repression was not associated with lower GE, but P site trees had CE that was 24.5% lower than M site trees. Average GE of D and CD trees was 28% lower than that of SP trees, while mean CE for the D trees was 46% greater than that of CD, and 80% greater than for SP trees. Between M and P sites, canopy LAI and Q per unit leaf area did not differ. Needle nitrogen (N) concentrations of M site trees were 7.6% greater than for P site trees. SP tree needles had the highest concentration of N and phosphorus. The nutrient advantage enjoyed by SP trees presumably allowed them to maintain higher GE for a given Q/Al. The fastest growing trees were the large D and CD trees from M sites. As LAI did not differ between sites, height repression on P sites may be a result of total leaf area being distributed among too many small trees.},

  abstract = {Cerrado is a biome that occupies about 25% of the Brazilian territory and is characterized by a gradient of grassland to savanna and forest formations and by high species richness. It has been severely affected by degradation and deforestation and has been heavily fragmented over the past 4-5 decades. Despite the recognized overall ecological importance of the Cerrado, there are only few studies focusing on the quantification of biomass in this biome. We conducted such a case study in the South-East of Brazil in a cerrado sensu stricto (cerrado s.s.) with the goal to produce estimates of above- and belowground biomass and to develop allometric equations. A number of 120 trees from 18 species were destructively sampled and partitioned into the components: leaves, branches and bole. Five models with {DBH} (D), height (H), {D2H} and wood density ({WD)} as independent variables were tested for the development of allometric models for individual tree aboveground biomass (leaves+branches+bole). One model based on basal area ({BA)} as a stand parameter was also tested as an alternative approach for predicting aboveground biomass in the stand level. Belowground biomass was estimated by subsampling on 10 sample plots. Mean aboveground tree biomass (bole, branches and leaves) was estimated to be 62,965.5 kg ha-1({SE=14.6%)} and belowground biomass accounted for 37,501.8 kg ha-1 ({SE=23%).} The best-fit equation for the estimation of individual tree aboveground biomass include {DBH} and wood density as explanatory variables (R2=0.898; {SEE=0.371)} and is applicable for the diameter range of this study (5.0-27.6 cm) and in environments with similar conditions of the cerrado s.s. sampled. In the stand level, the model tested presented a higher goodness of fit than the single tree models (R2=0.934; {SEE=0.224).} Our estimates of aboveground biomass are higher than reported by other studies developed in the same physiognomy, but the estimates of belowground biomass are within the range of values reported in other studies from sites in cerrado s.s. Both biomass estimates, however, exhibit relatively large standard errors. The root-to-shoot ratio of the sample trees is in the magnitude of reported values for savanna ecosystems, but smaller than estimated from other studies in the cerrado s.s.},

A destructive harvest was implemented two growing seasons following litter application to evaluate treatment impacts on patterns of aboveground biomass allocation and to develop allometric functions enabling prediction of aboveground biomass components. We examined relative allocation to foliage, crown wood, and stemwood; and the proportion of current-year and second-year foliage in the upper vs. the lower crown. No treatment effects were observed in general allocation patterns between foliage, crown wood, and stemwood mass, although treatments did significantly increase the ratio of current-year to second-year foliage in the upper crown. Biomass allocation patterns within trees did vary with tree size. The ratio of foliage to woody biomass remained similar across the range of tree sizes examined; but within the woody component, the amount of crown wood relative to stemwood increased with tree size. The ratio of current-year to second-year foliage remained similar in the lower crown, but the proportion of second-year foliage in the upper crown increased with d.b.h. Statistically significant treatment differences were found in the allometric relationships for estimating stemwood, crown wood, and foliar biomass. In all cases, litter application treatments increased the slope of the relationship between the aboveground biomass component and tree size. Our results suggest that failure to account for treatment-related effects on tree allometry could result in estimation errors of 5-15 percent for individual aboveground biomass components.},

The analysis allowed us to conclude that foliage mass was not affected by the silvicultural treatment, tree size or competitive status. Fine root biomass showed an inverse relationship with fertilization. Growth efficiency was not affected by the management treatment, tree size, or intraspecific competition. The greater stem wood allocation recorded in the agroforestry treatment than in the forestry regime, is interpreted as a response to two different types of competition. Competition for light appears to induce growth in height and diameter as a function of local environment conditions. Competition for nutrients appears to reduce allocation to fine roots and increase allocation to stem wood.},

Models for estimating crown profile in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) were developed from attributes of individual whorl branches, including basal diameter, total length, angle of origin, and height from ground. The prediction system consisted of four equations to predict whorl branch basal diameter, branch length, branch angle of origin, and corresponding crown radius. The system is entered with three standard individual tree measurements: diameter at breast height ({DBH)}, total height, and height to crown base. Four approaches were developed for modeling crown profile with this system of equations, distinguished by parameter estimation method, modeling data subset, and the specific form by which whorl branch diameter was represented (mean vs maximum diameter). A system-of-equations parameter-estimation technique (modified three-stage least squares) was applied to account for the correlation of error terms across the equations, and this procedure was compared with ordinary and nonlinear least squares methods. The resulting crown profile prediction systems were evaluated under both theoretical and empirical criteria. The recommended system appears to perform well against validation data on both an equation (branch) level and system (crown profile) level.},

Efficient operational deployment of genetic materials requires an understanding of possible site and silvicultural treatment interactions to maximize yield potential. We examined genotype (family) by environmental interactions through age 5 years using a factorial experiment consisting of silvicultural treatment intensity (operational versus intensive), planting density (1334 versus 2990 trees ha-1) and families (seven elite full-sib loblolly and six elite full-sib slash pine families). In January of 2000, randomized complete block, split-plot experiments were installed at two locations for each species in southeast Georgia and northeast Florida. Five years after planting, both loblolly and slash pine demonstrated significant interactions among several factors: genotype x location (p = 0.028 and p = 0.016, respectively), genotype x silvicultural treatment intensity (p = 0.055 and p = 0.059), and silvicultural treatment intensity x density (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001) for basal area (BA) and standing stem volume (VOL). Genotype x silvicultural treatment interactions were positive, with the best overall performing families responding the greatest to intensive treatment. There were changes in slash pine family rankings between locations, which were partly explained by reductions in growth associated with a combination of fusiform rust infection [Cronartium quercum (Berk.) Miyabe ex Shirai f. sp. fusiforme] and wind damage from the 2004 hurricane season. No three-way interactions, which included family, were evident and all genetic sources were stable across the contrasting planting densities. At age 5, loblolly pine outperformed slash pine (p = 0.0001), especially under the intensive silvicultural intensity. While loblolly performance was similar whether deployed in mixtures or pure family blocks, slash pine tended to be more productive in intimate mixtures than when grown in pure family blocks (p = 0.0754 for aboveground biomass).},

We analysed the relationships between vital rates (growth and survival) and four morphological traits (SLA, biomass allocation to stems, leaves and roots). We hypothesised that these traits represent differentiation axes in the way seedlings face the heterogeneous light regime typical of the CF understorey. For all species, traits between the different light levels, i.e. allocation to leaves, roots and stems differed among light levels. Five species had the largest SLA in the lowest light levels at the end of the experiment (Citharexylum, Dendropanax, Fraxinus, Quercus and Magnolia). Juglans was the only species with a large SLA at the highest light level (377.47 cm2 g-1). In contrast, light levels did not cause any significant variation in SLA of Persea and Simplococarpon at the end of the experiment. The relative height growth rates (RHGR) of the seedlings of five species were significantly different between light levels (P <0.05). Overall, all species grew better in the highest light levels. The RHGR of three species were correlated positively with SLA. In turn, allocation to stem, leaves and root biomass were strongly correlated with the RHGR of five species (e.g. Citharexylum, Dendropanax and Fraxinus). Survival did not vary significantly between treatments in any species, only in the case of Simplococarpon (P<0.05) and was correlated with all morphological variables. For this species, Peto and Peto's test showed a significantly larger survival of seedlings in the highest light level. The mean responses of these species based on all traits to the controlled light variation did not differed significantly. Our results show that these species display a wide range of resource allocation patterns when exposed to the varying light conditions that may be found in the forest understorey and highlight the role of morphological traits in this variation.},

  abstract = {Abstract - Aboveground biomass, litter production and weight loss of litter due to decomposition were monitored in two forest ecosystems in the Sierra de la Demanda, Spain, a Mediterranean climatic zone, over a 3-years period. The two ecosystems were a mature beech forest (Fagus sylvatica L.) and a Scots pine plantation (Pinus sylvestris L.). The aboveground biomass was estimated by cutting and weighing seven trees from each site according to diameter classes, recording the categories of trunk, branches and leaves. The results indicate a total biomass of 152.1 Mg/ha in the pine stand and 132.7 Mg/ha in the beech stand. The percentage distribution of biomass weight of trunks, branches and leaves was similar in both forests. The higher biomass in relation to DBH was estimated in the beech forest, which seems to indicate that it would not be very suitable to reforest land that is appropriate for beech with pine. The litter fall was 5 791 kg/ha/year in the pine forest and 4 682 kg/ha/year in the beech forest, although variations from year to year were observed, mostly due to water stress in summer. Weight loss due to decomposition of litter was similar in the two forest ecosystems, apparently due to the similarity in rainfall distribution at the sites. Jenny's litter decomposition index (K) and Olson's litter decomposition index (Ko) were higher for the Scots pine stand than for the beech stand, K: 0.46 and 0.37, K0: 0.82 and 0.59, respectively, and Jenny's leaves and Olson's decomposition indices were similar.},

  title = {Leaves of pioneer and later-successional trees have similar lifetime carbon gain in tropical secondary forest},
  volume = {91},
  issue = {4},
  abstract = {Different life history strategies among tropical rain forest species are generally related to inherent trade-offs in leaf and crown traits, with early-successional species having traits that facilitate high productivity but a relatively wasteful use of resources and shade-tolerant later-successional species exhibiting the opposite strategy. But the degree to which these trait differences contribute to short- and long-term carbon gain of different species that coexist in natural forest has not been quantitatively scaled. We applied a canopy model in combination with measurements of canopy structure, mass distribution, and leaf photosynthesis to determine whole-plant daily photosynthesis (Ppl) of individuals of three short-lived pioneers (SLP), four later-successional species, and three lianas growing together in a 0.5-, 2-, and 3-yr-old secondary tropical forest stand. Whole-plant daily photosynthesis per unit leaf mass (Plfm) and aboveground mass (Pm) were assumed to indicate daily returns on investment at the leaf and crown level. By integrating these calculations with measured leaf longevities, we determined the lifetime carbon gain per unit leaf mass. Vegetation height and leaf area index increased with stand age. Two of the SLPs, Trema and Ochroma, increasingly dominated the top of the vegetation. In the 0.5-yr-old stand, these species also had the highest Pm and Plfm values. Whole-plant daily photosynthesis per unit leaf mass tended to decline with stand age but much more strongly so in the later-successional species than in the SLP. Leaf longevity was not significantly correlated with individual leaf traits (e.g., specific leaf area or leaf N content) but was strongly and negatively correlated with Plfm in the youngest stand. Later-successional species had considerably greater leaf longevities than SLP. Lifetime carbon gain per unit leaf mass, however, was relatively similar between the different species. Thus due to the strong negative correlation that exists between daily leaf productivity (Plfm) and longevity, short-lived pioneers and later-successional species achieve similar lifetime carbon gain per unit leaf mass in natural secondary forest. This could help explain why the slower-growing later-successional species are able to persist during the first years of succession.},

  abstract = {How long forest trees can sustain wood production with increasing age remains an open question, primarily because whole-crown structure and growth cannot be readily measured from the ground or on felled trees. We climbed and directly measured crown structures and growth rates of 43 un-suppressed individuals (site trees) of the two tallest species - Eucalyptus regnans and Sequoia sempervirens - representing a wide range of tree sizes and ages. In both species, ground-level measurements of annual growth, including height, ring width, and basal area increment, exhibited the oft-reported trend of decreasing growth (or no change in growth) with age, yet wood production of the entire main trunk and whole crown both increased with size and age up to and including the largest and oldest trees we measured. The balance between structural metrics of whole-crown respiratory demands (cambium area, inner bark volume, sapwood volume, and heartwood deposition area) and photosynthetic capacity (leaf area and green bark area) was statistically independent of size but not age. After accounting for the effect of size, trees with lower potential respiratory demands grew more than trees with higher potential respiratory demands per unit photosynthetic area. The strongest determinant of tree energy balance was the ratio of aboveground cambium area to leaf area. Among the site trees we examined, over 85% of the variation in annual wood production was explained by variation in size, and the proportion of total aboveground wood production in appendages (branches, limbs, and reiterated trunks) increased linearly with size. With increasing age in both species, the proportion of annual wood production converted to heartwood increased in main trunks and appendages. The oldest tree we measured produced more heartwood in its main trunk over 651 years (351 m3) than contained in any tree we measured  < 1500 years old. The two tallest tree species achieve similar stature despite divergent growth dynamics and ecologies. At one extreme, E. regnans attains great size quickly but dies relatively young because trees are susceptible to fire and fungi. At the other extreme, S. sempervirens attains great size more slowly but has a long lifespan because trees resist fire and prioritize investment in decay-resistant heartwood. Increasing wood production as trees age is a mechanism underlying the maintenance of biomass accumulation during forest development and the carbon-sink capacity of old-growth forests.},

A strong linear relationship existed between projected leaf area and sapwood area at breast height or sapwood at the base of the live crown despite the variability in foliage morphology. Ratios of leaf area to sapwood were 0.40 m2/cm2 at breast height and 0.57 m2/cm2 at crown base. Measurements of sapwood at the base of the live crown improved leaf area predictions because of sapwood taper below the crown base. A sapwood taper model was also developed.},

  abstract = {1 Monitoring of two canopy species Dicorynia guianensis and Vouacapoua americana (Caesalpiniaceae) in a tropical rain forest in French Guiana was used to investigate vegetative crown development at five organizational levels: leaf, metamer, extension unit, sympodial unit and whole crown. The effects of light availability and tree height on different traits were evaluated in trees < 25 m in height and compared with taller individuals (25-37 m). Path-analysis is used to illustrate the consequences of trait changes at multiple levels of organization for the whole crown level. 2 Tree height and canopy openness influenced crown development at each organizational level. Crowns in higher light levels had lower specific leaf area, greater leaf spacing, greater extension of all branches, and greater extension of the leader shoot. With increasing tree height, crowns had a lower specific leaf area, greater leaf area index and greater relative crown depth. 3 Vouacapoua showed some responses to light not seen in Dicorynia. In particular, Vouacapoua increased meristem activity with light, but the lack of response in Dicorynia may be due to moderate light levels rather than inability to respond. 4 Low leaf-display costs at low light availability may enable trees to survive light suppression. 5 Light availability cannot explain trait changes with tree height. Alternative explanations for trait changes with tree height are discussed. 6 Several of the relationships between plant traits and tree height or canopy openness became non-linear when taller trees (25-37 m) were included. In these taller trees, vegetative growth was reduced at all organizational levels, particularly in Vouacapoua, which does not grow as tall as Dicorynia. 7 Qualitatively, plant responses to light did not differ between trees of different height, and were similar to seedling and sapling data in the literature. Responses were, however, quantitatively different, suggesting that small saplings cannot serve as model organisms for crown development in taller trees.},

  abstract = {The comparative phenotypic plasticity of 16 species of tropical rainforest shrubs (genus Psychotria, Rubiaceae) was investigated by growing plants in three light environments on Barro Colorado Island ({BCI}, Panama). The three light environments gave daily photon flux densities ({PPFD)} similar to the natural light gradient from shaded forest understory to small and large canopy gaps. Six of the species are principally found in gaps or forest edge environments, whereas the other ten species are principally found in shaded understories. Interactions between light treatment and species resulted in unpredictable mean phenotypic expression across light treatments. Shoot relative growth rates ({RGR)} were similar for understory and gap species in the low light treatment. Gap species had significantly greater shoot {RGR} in the intermediate light treatment than in the high light treatment. Mean plasticity was significantly lower for morphological variables when com pared to physiological variables, while variation in plasticity was significantly greater for structural variables. Significant differences between gap and understory species were found in the plasticity of six out of the seven variables. The mean phenotypic plasticity of the seven variables was significantly greater for gap than for understory species. The high plasticity of gap species was consistent with the hypothesis that specialization in a more favorable environment increases plasticity. The species exhibited a wide range of leaf longevities, from four to 29 months, with gap species having, on average, shorter leaf lifespan than understory species. Mean phenotypic plasticity decreased with increasing leaf longevity. Selection for greater plasticity may be stronger in the gap species because gaps exhibit a relatively predictable decrease in {PPFD} for which plasticity could be adaptive. While we have found a significant correlation between phenotypic plasticity and habitat affiliation, phylogeny (subgenus ascription) was not correlated with plasticity or with plant performance in any given {PPFD} treatment, reinforcing the hypothesis that phenotypic plasticity has evolved through natural selection in this diverse genus.},

  abstract = {Secondary forests are a major terrestrial carbon sink and reliable estimates of their carbon stocks are pivotal for understanding the global carbon balance and initiatives to mitigate CO2 emissions through forest management and reforestation. A common method to quantify carbon stocks in forests is the use of allometric regression models to convert forest inventory data to estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB). The use of allometric models implies decisions on the selection of extant models or the development of a local model, the predictor variables included in the selected model, and the number of trees and species for destructive biomass measurements. We assess uncertainties associated with these decisions using data from 94 secondary forest plots in central Panama and 244 harvested trees belonging to 26 locally abundant species. AGB estimates from species-specific models were used to assess relative errors of estimates from multispecies models. To reduce uncertainty in the estimation of plot AGB, including wood specific gravity (WSG) in the model was more important than the number of trees used for model fitting. However, decreasing the number of trees increased uncertainty of landscape-level AGB estimates substantially, while including WSG had limited effects on the accuracy of the landscape-level estimates. Predictions of stand and landscape AGB varied strongly among models, making model choice an important source of uncertainty. Local models provided more accurate AGB estimates than foreign models, but high variability in carbon stocks across the landscape implies that developing local models is only justified when landscape sampling is sufficiently intensive.},

Foliage, branch, stem sapwood, heartwood and bark components of aboveground biomass were measured in 117 trees sampled from 17 stands varying in age, density and site fertility. A subsample of 32 trees was measured for belowground biomass excluding fine roots. Biomass of fine roots was estimated from the results of an earlier study. Statistical models were constructed to predict dry mass ({DW)} of components from tree height and basal area, and time derivatives of these models were used to estimate biomass increments from height growth and basal area growth. Biomass growth (G) was estimated by adding estimated biomass turnover rates to increments, and gross photosynthetic production (P) was estimated by adding estimated component respiration rates to growth. The method, which predicts the time course of G, P and biomass increment in individual trees as functions of height growth and basal area growth, was applied to eight example trees representing different dominance positions and site fertilities. Estimated G and P of the example trees varied with competition, site fertility and tree height, reaching maximum values of 22 and 43 kg({DW)} year(-1), respectively. The site types did not show marked differences in productivity of trees of the same height, although height growth was greater on the fertile site. The {G:P} ratio decreased with tree height from 65 to 45%. Growth allocation to needles and branches increased with increasing dominance, whereas growth allocation to the stem decreased. Growth allocation to branches decreased and growth allocation to coarse roots increased with increasing tree size. Trees at the poor site allocated 49% more to fine roots than trees at the fertile site. The belowground parts accounted for 25 to 55% of annual G, increasing with tree size and decreasing with site fertility. Annual G and P per unit needle mass varied over the ranges 1.9-2.4 and 3.5-4.0 kg({DW)} kg(-1), respectively. The relationship between P and needle mass in the example trees was linear and relatively independent of competition, site fertility and age.},

Allometric equations relating dry weights of stemwood, stembark, branches and leaves to tree diameter at breast height ({DBH)} were developed to estimate aboveground tree biomass. Equations were not significantly different among the three site qualities. Average total aboveground tree biomass for all sites increased with stand age from 1.4 t ha-1 in 2-year-old stands (varying from 0.45 to 2.1 t ha-1 on poor and good sites, respectively) to 202 t ha-1 in the 75-year-old stand (156 and 234 t ha-1 on poor and good sites, respectively). As stand age increased, an increasing proportion of annual biomass increment was allocated to stems, but nutrients were preferentially accumulated in the leaves. Nutrient content of aboveground tree biomass increased with stand age and was generally in the order of N \&gt; Ca \&gt; K \&gt; Mg \&gt; P. Average rates of nutrients accumulation in biomass were greatest in the early stages of stand development, and less marked as stands aged. The concentrations of nutrients in tissues decreased in the following order: leaf \&gt; branch \&gt; stembark \&gt; stemwood. Understory minor vegetation contributed little to the nutrient pool of these paper birch ecosystems. Mineral soil contained the largest amount of nutrients among the various ecosystem components.},

  abstract = {Stand structure, height and diameter growth, above- and below-ground biomass, and nutrient concentrations and content were determined for a 35-year-old fire-origin paper birch (Betula papyrifera) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) mixed-species stand in the Sub-Boreal Spruce ({SBS)} zone of British Columbia. Paper birch, which formed the dominant overstory following the 1961 fire, had normal distributions of height and diameter classes. Subalpine fir, which dominated the understory, had the reverse J-shaped height and diameter distributions that are expected of a shade tolerant, climax species. Paper birch grew more than three times the height of subalpine fir. Growing in the summer shade of the birch, subalpine fir had slow but steady height growth during the first 10-15 years, after which height growth declined somewhat. Allometric equations, relating dry weight of foliage, branches, stemwood, stembark, roots, and total biomass to diameter at breast height ({DBH)}, were developed to estimate above- and below-ground biomass. Total biomass of paper birch reached 83.2 t ha-1, while subalpine fir biomass was 26.7 t ha-1. Subalpine fir allocated more biomass to foliage and branches compared to paper birch. Foliage of paper birch had higher nutrient concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg than subalpine fir foliage. Branches and stembark of subalpine fir had higher P, and Ca concentrations than paper birch. Subalpine fir branches contained more of all examined nutrients than paper birch branches. This is a significant component in nutrient cycling of the mixed-species forest.},

  abstract = { Background and Aims Mongolian Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica) is one of the principal species used for windbreak and sand stabilization in arid and semi-arid areas in northern China. A model-assisted analysis of its canopy architectural development and functions is valuable for better understanding its behaviour and roles in fragile ecosystems. However, due to the intrinsic complexity and variability of trees, the parametric identification of such models is currently a major obstacle to their evaluation and their validation with respect to real data. The aim of this paper was to present the mathematical framework of a stochastic functional-structural model (GL2) and its parameterization for Mongolian Scots pines, taking into account inter-plant variability in terms of topological development and biomass partitioning. \nMethods In GL2, plant organogenesis is determined by the realization of random variables representing the behaviour of axillary or apical buds. The associated probabilities are calibrated for Mongolian Scots pines using experimental data including means and variances of the numbers of organs per plant in each order-based class. The functional part of the model relies on the principles of source-sink regulation and is parameterized by direct observations of living trees and the inversion method using measured data for organ mass and dimensions. \nKey Results The final calibration accuracy satisfies both organogenetic and morphogenetic processes. Our hypothesis for the number of organs following a binomial distribution is found to be consistent with the real data. Based on the calibrated parameters, stochastic simulations of the growth of Mongolian Scots pines in plantations are generated by the Monte Carlo method, allowing analysis of the inter-individual variability of the number of organs and biomass partitioning. Three-dimensional (3D) architectures of young Mongolian Scots pines were simulated for 4-, 6- and 8-year-old trees. \nConclusions This work provides a new method for characterizing tree structures and biomass allocation that can be used to build a 3D virtual Mongolian Scots pine forest. The work paves the way for bridging the gap between a single-plant model and a stand model.

  abstract = {A small watershed in the White Mountains of New Hampshire bearing mesophytic, cool-temperate, broadleaf-deciduous forests was studied. Acer saccharum, Betula alleghaniensis, and Fagus grandifolia are dominant, but toward higher elevations Picea rubens also occurs and indicate the transition toward subalpine climate. The stands are young (following cutting in 1909-17) but contain older trees; stand composition is thought reasonably representative of the climax. For application of the Brookhaven system of forest dimension analysis, 93 sample trees of major species were cut and roots excavated in 1965. Acer pensylvanicum, a common understory species, was also studied.  Mean dimensions of sample trees, and the constants for the system of logarithmic regressions relating volume, surface, mass, and growth to diameter at breast height and other independent variables, show decrease in tree sizes and height/diameter ratios toward higher elevations. Stand characteristics, based on application of the regressions to forest samples, show trends of decrease for the elevation belts from low to high: stem basal area 26.3, 23.7, and 22.0 m2/ha, weighted mean tree height 16.9, 16.7, and 10.8 m, weighted mean age 124, 95, and 83 yr, stem wood volume 176, 155, and 103 m-3/ha, aboveground biomass (dry matter) 162, 152, and 102 Mg/ha, estimated volume increment 379, 365, and 223 cm3/m2/yr, aboveground net primary productivity (1956-60) 1127, 1041, and 790 g/m2/yr, and leaf area ratio 6.2, 5.7, and 5.5 m2/m2. Biomass (and, presumably, production) of root systems is 18%-21% of that aboveground.  Both aboveground and belowground estimates of biomass have subsequently been validated with independent stand-scale data in nearby forests.},

  abstract = {A fundamental tool in carbon accounting is tree-based allometry, whereby easily measured variables can be used to estimate aboveground biomass ({AGB).} To explore the potential of general allometry we combined raw datasets from 14 different woodland species, mainly eucalypts, from 11 sites across the Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales. Access to the raw data allowed two predictor variables, tree diameter (at 1.3-m height; D) and tree height (H), to be used singly or in various combinations to produce eight candidate models. Following natural log (ln) transformation, the data, consisting of 220 individual trees, were re-analysed in two steps: first as 20 species--site-specific {AGB} equations and, second, as a single general {AGB} equation. For each of the eight models, a comparison of the species--site-specific with the general equations was made with the Akaike information criterion ({AIC).} Further model evaluation was undertaken by a leave-one-out cross-validation technique. For each of the model forms, the species--site-specific equations performed better than the general equation. However, the best performing general equation, ln({AGB)} = --2.0596 + 2.1561 ln(D) + 0.1362 (ln(H))2, was only marginally inferior to the species--site-specific equations. For the best general equation, back-transformed predicted v. observed values (on a linear scale) were highly concordant, with a slope of 0.99. The only major deviation from this relationship was due to seven large, hollow trees (more than 35% loss of cross-sectional stem area at 1.3 m) at a single species--site combination. Our best-performing general model exhibited remarkable stability across species and sites, when compared with the species--site equations. We conclude that there is encouraging evidence that general predictive equations can be developed across sites and species for Australia's woodlands. This simplifies the conversion of long-term inventory measurements into {AGB} estimates and allows more resources to be focused on the extension of such inventories.},

  abstract = {Crown architecture was analyzed for Scaphium macropodum (Sterculiaceae), a common shade-tolerant emergent tree of a tropical rain forest in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Saplings and poles shorter than 12 m in height had no branches, and gathered their leaves at the ends of the stem. The leaves changed from entire to palmately-parted with increasing tree size. The parted leaves increased the light penetration through the clustered foliage. The size of leaves including the blade and petiole ranged from 22 cm to 147 cm. Because the weight of petiole per blade increased with leaf size, the leaf could not be enlarged infinitely. Taller trees with lateral branches bore small (about 40 cm in length) entire leaves. The light intensity in the forest increased from the ground to about 12 m tall and was nearly constant from 12 m to 18 m. Crown architecture of S. macropodum adapted to this light environment. The monoaxial trees lower than 12 m could thus increase the amount of light with vertical elongation, and the branched trees higher than 12 m could increase it by means of lateral extension of crown area.},

One hundred and ninety-one living trees 1.3m high and higher, three lianas living on dead trees, one small standing liana, and one palm were felled, and their sizes were measured using the stratified clip technique and recorded. Of these sample plants, the largest was a Shorea laevis tree : total height was 70.7m; stem diameter at the terminal of its buttresses, 4.6m high, was 130.5cm; stem volume was 41.1m^3; stem dry weight was 33129.768kg; branch dry weight was 9586.120kg; leaf dry weight was 107.614kg; leaf area was 767.372m^2. The plant mass of dependent plants living on independent plants was also measured using the stratified clip technique. The aboveground biomass in a narrow 0.125ha sampling spot was calculated by summing the plant mass values of individual sample plants. It totaled 872.949t/ha in dry weight for all living plants and 7.962ha/ha in leaf area, although these values were too large to represent the mean biomass of the dipterocarp forest in the study area because that forest patch included the huge emergent tree.},
